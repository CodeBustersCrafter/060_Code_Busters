get close to half the vote on the first count. While this indicates that no candidate has succeeded in exciting a majority of voters, it also means that it is increasingly likely that the 2024 election will be the first presidential poll decided on a count of second and third preferences. We urge civil society and the Elections Commission to intensify efforts to educate voters about using their preferences to ensure that every vote counts.”  Analysis of the MRP model estimates for August reveal differences in the support base for each candidate. Support for AK Dissanayake was strongest among the youth, with a majority (53%) supporting him, and among Sinhala voters (42%). The most affluent third of voters (38%) supported both AK Dissanayake and Ranil Wickremesinghe. In contrast, Sajith Premadasa led among the poorest third of voters (40%).
More than half of Sri Lankan Tamils (55%) and Estate/ Indian Tamils (53%) supported Sajith Premadasa, while two-thirds of Muslims (71%) backed him. R  better estimates. 
IHP’s SLOTS MRP methodology first estimates the relationship between a wide variety of characteristics about respondents and their opinions – in this case, ‘If there was a Presidential Election today, who would you vote for?’– in a multilevel statistical model that also smooths month to month changes. It then uses a large data file calibrated to the national population to predict voting intent in each month since Oct. 2021, based on what the multilevel model indicates about their probability of voting for various parties (‘post-stratification’) at each point in time. The multilevel model was estimated 100 times to reflect underlying uncertainties in the model and to obtain margins of error. The voting intent results for previous months have changed in this update as more data were collected after the last release and these changes are within the margin of error.


The2024 Sri Lankan presidential electionis scheduled to be held on 21 September 2024, where voters will choose apresidentfor a five-year term.[1][2]Incumbent PresidentRanil Wickremesingheis seeking re-election as anindependentcandidate, making him the first sitting president to run for re-election sinceMahinda Rajapaksain2015.[3][4][5]

Background

The last direct presidential elections held in Sri Lanka were in2019, whereSLPPcandidateGotabaya Rajapaksawon the election in a landslide victory, defeating his main opponentSajith Premadasa.[6][7]

Rajapaksa would eventuallyresignon 14 July 2022 amidst the2022 Sri Lankan protests.[8]This triggered anindirect presidential electionvia Parliament a week later, to elect a successor according to the Article 40 of the Constitution.[9]Ranil Wickremesinghe, who had been appointed asPrime Ministerby Rajapaksa just two months earlier, received the most votes and was sworn in as the 9th President of Sri Lanka on 21 July 2022.[10][11]

Article 40 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka states that "Any person so succeeding to the office of President shall hold office only for the unexpired period of the term of office of the President vacating office.[12]President Wickremesinghe's term is due to expire on 17 November 2024.

Discussion surrounding the 2024 election has been a major topic since the beginning of the year. TheElection Commissionhas stated that the election must be held between 17 September and 16 October, as required by the Constitution. On 26 July, the Election Commission issued aGazettenotification declaring that the election would be held on 21 September 2024, with nominations for candidates to be submitted by 15 August.[13]The commission chose to hold the election on a Saturday, stating that this would help ensure a highvoter turnout. On the same day, Ranil Wickremesinghe announced his candidacy for a second term as president, running as anindependentcandidate.[1][5]

Approximately 17 million people are eligible to vote in this election.[14]

Electoral system

Type of electoral system

The President of Sri Lanka is elected through a system of limitedranked voting. Voters can express up to three ranked preferences for the presidency. If no candidate receives more than 50% of all valid votes in the first count, all candidates except the two who received the highest number of votes are eliminated. The second and third preference votes of the eliminated candidates are then redistributed to the remaining two candidates until one of them secures an outright majority.[15]

In practice, this system has seen no use. Every presidential election since the first in1982has resulted in a candidate from one of the major parties or alliances winning an outright majority in the first count. Consequently, most voters choose to mark only one candidate on their ballots, and many are either unaware that they can rank multiple candidates or choose not to exercise that prerogative.[16][17]

Voting procedure

The Election Commission outlined the voting procedure on 30 August 2024, detailing the ranked voting system due to the multiple candidates contesting the presidential election, ensuring voters were informed on how to cast and submit their ballots.[18][19]

Postal voting

The Election Commission announced the dates and locations for postal voting in a media release on 29 August 2024. This facility is available only to pre-approved officials engaged in election duties.[20][21]Postal voting will be conducted on 4, 5, 6, 11, and 12 September, strictly according to the provided schedule.[22][23]

Ballot boxes and security systems

TheElection Commission of Sri Lankais reportedly considering the exclusive use of cardboard ballot boxes in the upcoming elections, replacing the traditional wooden ones. A mix of wooden and cardboard ballot boxes was utilised during the2019 Sri Lankan presidential electionand the2020 Sri Lankan parliamentary election.[24]

Candidates

By the end of candidate registration on 15 August, the Election Commission had accepted a total of 39 applications for the presidential election, the highest number ever recorded for a presidential election in Sri Lanka.[25]One candidate, Mohamed Illiyas, died prior to the election.[26]Despite the record number of candidates, none were female.[27][28]

One of the main reasons for the proliferation of candidates is the low election deposit required to contest – Rs. 50,000 (US$170) for party candidates and Rs. 75,000 (US$250) for independent candidates. These amounts that have remained unchanged since the introduction of presidential elections in 1982.[86][87]

Many of the minor candidates are proxy or dummy candidates put forward by the main contenders to maximise the benefits of candidacy, such as having two agents at every polling station, assigning counting agents, receiving free slots on state television, and gaining general media coverage.[88][89][90]
