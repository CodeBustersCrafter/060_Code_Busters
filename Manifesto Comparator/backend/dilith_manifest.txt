                    We pledge to:

1.   Erase the pervasive negativity and self-doubt among our people
     by laying the foundation for a motivated, confident nation driven
     by an entrepreneurial mindset.

2. Ensure the creation of an educated and healthy populace by
   updating and modernising the free education and healthcare
   systems, while ensuring state welfare for those who need support.

3. Enable a national economy that produces valuable outputs
   for the local and global economy by utilising local resources,
   knowledge, and human capital.

4. Build strong state, private, and cooperative sectors that are
   driven by an entrepreneurial mindset.

5. Expand export markets through the diversification of products
   and services and by enhancing value addition to increase export
   revenue and ensure our motherland benefits from such revenues.

6. Curb corruption by investigating recent incidents of large-scale
   corruption, with a view to punishing the wrongdoers and vesting
   stolen wealth with the people, and minimise tax evasion by
   creating greater transparency through a digitalised tax system
   and issuing Unique Identification Numbers to all individuals.

7. Ensure the sustainability of mankind and all forms of life by
   introducing sustainable strategies and practices to sectors such
   as agriculture, energy, industry, and construction.

8. Strategically and equitably engage with countries of the world by
   prioritising national interest in the context of a multipolar world.

9. Build a proud modern nation free of any differences of religion,
   race, or caste, founded upon the civilisational values of our
   heritage.

10. Create a happy nation by recognising that happiness is true
    wealth and focusing on holistic development that balances our
    people’s physical, mental, and spiritual aspects.
