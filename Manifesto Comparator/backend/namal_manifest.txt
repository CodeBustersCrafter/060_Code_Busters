NAMAL RAJAPAKSA - NAMAL VISION - MANIFESTO


FOR YOU
A DEVELOPED COUNTRY
FOR YOU A DEVELOPED COUNTRY



Venerable Monks, Priests, Brothers and Sisters,

                My Vision For A Developed Sri Lanka
In the 76 years since independence, the decade of 2005-2014 marked its Golden
Era. The very purpose of politics was redefined by His Excellency President Mahinda
Rajapaksa with his unparalleled service for our motherland through his unwavering
courage and brave leadership. He ended the brutal war that destroyed the progress
that was to be of our motherland for 30 years. He brought about the dignified
freedom of living in one country for all Sri Lankans.

He did not stop there and launched the Mahinda Chinthana programme which
would lift Sri Lanka towards a developed state. All Sri Lankans, united by equality in
diversity worked hand in hand to make Sri Lanka the fastest-growing country in the
world.

We built modern strategic national assets such as the Colombo Port City, Hambantota
Port and Mattala Airport based on a long-term plan with clear economic growth
targets. The transportation system covering the entire country, including highways
and miles-long bridges, was built to connect the North and the South and distribute
the opportunities and benefits of development to the entire nation. New power
plants and irrigation systems were built to meet all that development needs. Marvels
such as the Lotus Tower were built to provide modern technological facilities to the
youth. None of them were isolated constructs. They are all interrelated sustainable
national resources.

But Sri Lanka was dragged back into a dark age by the government that was
elected in 2015. The hard-won freedom by the heroes who sacrificed their lives was
completely stalled in just four failed years. The amount of public debt increased and
by 2019, the country's economy was about to collapse. State security weakened
and eventually, terrorism rose its ugly head. Mother Lanka again succumbed to a
miserable fate.

It is with great hope that you elected the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna in 2020
to rebuild our broken motherland. But just as we started to raise our head again,
disaster struck. The deadly COVID-19 virus ravaged our country and the entire
world for two long years. After being shut down for months, the country's economy
deteriorated further. But with the help of the armed forces, health professionals and
public service as well as all those who volunteered, we managed to save the lives
of hundreds of thousands of people who otherwise would have succumbed to the
plague. Even during that very difficult period, we were able to pay salaries to all
government employees, subsidise the low-income residents, vaccinate all people,
and even pay instalments for the loans taken by the previous governments.

                                                                                     2
NAMAL VISION


But the economic crisis, which was already severe, worsened. I admit that more
suitable decisions could have been taken regarding certain matters. The people
who suffered due to all these issues took to the streets to release their pressure. But
the people's struggle was soon turned to violence by some local and foreign forces
to achieve their heinous political agendas. At that critical moment, we stepped
down without harming any of the protesters, because our state is worth a million
times more to us than political position power. It was a valuable lesson for the whole
world about non-violence in governance.

I have the political experience gained as an elected Member of Parliament for 14
consecutive years and as a Minister during a very challenging two-year period. At
the age of 38, as the youngest presidential candidate in history, I wholeheartedly
accepted the challenge of running for this year's presidential election from the Sri
Lanka Podujana Peramuna. I have the obligation to build a developed country for
you by protecting the national policies of the left-leaning political camp founded by
the likes of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike and D. A. Rajapaksa.

By integrating sustainable solutions for the challenges of the 21st century, and the
modern technological revolution with Mahinda Chinthana, let us start again from
where the development of this country was stopped. I am ready to shoulder that
challenge. I only expect your blessings. I respectfully present to you my policy
programme titled Namal Vision to Build a Developed Country For You.

I pledge to you that the country that was broken by the economic crisis will be
freed from it and developed safely, just as Mahinda Rajapaksa liberated and united
the country that was torn apart by war. I pledge to protect the unity of our country,
protect the democratic values of the republic, protect the state assets, protect the
Sambuddha Sasana, and protect the freedom of all citizens while achieving the
development you expect.

For you,




Namal Rajapaksa

IMMEDIATE RELIEF, FOR YOU
The country’s economy is currently almost entirely driven by the
International Monetary Fund. Although it appears as a progressive
approach to resolving the economic crisis, it is not the optimum solution.

While it may be helpful that the government revenue is increased, it
is certainly disadvantageous that the wider economic activity of the
country is suppressed due to the unbearable taxes. Thus, our stance is
that we should achieve the IMF’s proposed targets without unreasonably
and only taxing the people.

Therefore, while we aim to achieve the government's revenue and
expenditure targets, we also aim to revive the country’s economy
through a rapid relief programme.

  FULFILMENT FOR ALL
    The need for food comes first before any other need. The primary aim of all
    development is to keep the people from hunger. That is our immediate priority.
    No one on this land should stay in hunger. Our first mission is to make every
    person consume at least three healthy meals a day.

  IMMEDIATE TAX RELIEF
    Value Added Tax (VAT) and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Tax imposed upon all
    citizens will be systematically revised. The possible loss of revenue, as a result,
    will be recouped through already identified efficiency improvements and gap-
    filling in the Customs, Inland Revenue and Excise Departments.

    With the easing of the tax burden, the cost of living will fall to a bearable level.

    The current inefficient and costly method of tax collection will be replaced
    with an effective ICT system thereby allowing citizens to pay their taxes easily.

    The additional income that comes to the people’s hands as a result of the tax
    revision will be spent on buying more goods and services which will in turn
    boost the country’s production and increase the market revenue.




                                                                                       6
NAMAL VISION



     SAMURDHI STRENGTHENED
      Low-income citizens who are without a steady source of income will be given
      the Samurdhi financial aid package sufficient to consume three healthy meals
      per day.

     RELIEF FOR YOUR UTILITY BILLS
      One of the region's highest monthly water and electricity tariffs that are
      currently being forced upon the people will be immediately lowered to an
      optimal level.

     AFFORDABLE FERTILISER
      Going by the earlier Mahinda Chinthana policy, paddy, vegetable and fruit
      farmers will receive a permanent fertiliser subsidy scheme. A reasonable price
      scheme will be extended to other crop plantations including tea. This will allow
      higher yields so that the food prices can be brought down within the first two
      seasons.

      A special Market Integration Unit will be set up to export the extra yield with
      value addition.

     ENERGISING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
      Import restrictions which are killing the small, medium and large enterprises
      will be systematically removed allowing the local entrepreneurs to reconnect
      with their global supply chains and quickly revive their businesses.

      Parallel to the imported goods, local manufacturers will also be supported.

      The Market Integration Unit will work with local farmers to grow fast-yielding
      economic crops and with local manufacturers to produce high-quality goods,
      while also connecting them to the international markets.

     NEW JOB OPPORTUNITIES
      A special project will be implemented to recruit citizens for local and foreign
      jobs, especially in the fields of Health, Education and Training, Software
      Engineering, Data Analysis, Cyber Security, Product Design, and Digital
      Content marketing.

      A new personal loan scheme will be introduced to cover the initial cost of
      recruitment and travel for those who are selected for foreign employment.

                                                  FOR YOU A DEVELOPED COUNTRY



 EMPOWERING YOUTH FINANCIALLY
 New ICT Clusters will be introduced covering all divisions to support the youth
 with education, training and access to deliver ICT services to foreign clients.

 Tariffs on internet connectivity will be immediately revised as an essential
 service needed for the above jobs.

 A personal loan scheme will be introduced for the youth to buy computers and
 other essential hardware.

 TOURISM BOOSTER
 A Special Tourism Promotion Project will be launched with the priority of
 increasing the foreign revenue earned through tourism, which is essential for
 economic stabilisation.

 Katunayake and Mattala airports will facilitate the above through essential
 management changes.

 Both airports will provide additional facilities to attract the popular Budget
 Airlines.

 Low-interest loans will be introduced specially for people working in the travel,
 tourism and leisure sectors to develop their businesses.

 Homestay Tourism will be promoted with financial support attached to training.

 Tourist Visa duration will be extended to six months.

 PROFESSIONAL PUBLIC SERVICES
 An Integrated ICT system will be implemented across all public services thereby
 reducing the time wastage, cost of travel and unnecessary paperwork when
 obtaining essential public services from birth certificates to death certificates.

 Migrant workers will be able to renew their passports within a week after
 introducing printing facilities at key Sri Lankan embassies.

 UNINTERRUPTED MEDICINE SUPPLY
 Current shortages of medicines and medical supplies will be resolved promptly
 so that all patients island-wide will receive essential healthcare services without
 delays.




                                                                                   8
NAMAL VISION



     FAST-TRACKING INVESTMENTS
     A special investment facilitation scheme will be implemented to secure quick
     investments exceeding US$ 250,000. A special Golden Visa scheme will be
     offered to such investors.

     PERFORMANCE MONITORING SYSTEM
     All the above short-term relief projects will be implemented, monitored and
     continuously improved by a Special Project Force composed of members of
     parliament and state officials under the direct supervision of the President.

       Infrastructure                                      Religious Freedom

    Most of the development work in this         This policy programme is developed
    country fell short because of a lack of      based on the above Integrated
    integration with other related sectors and   Development Goals with speciﬁc and
    stakeholders. Namal Vision is built on       time-based targets, and with innovation
    Integration. Therefore, it is called the     strategies to achieve them in the
    Integrated Development Model.                short-term, mid-term and the long-term.

                                                 The main goal of the Integrated
                                                 Development Model is to realise the
                                                 State Priorities. To do that we follow a
                                                 strategic innovation approach. And to
                                                 drive that innovation we need a strategic
                                                 Investment      Framework.    Individual
                                                 Freedoms must be secured and are in

1. STATE PRIORITIES
                                                  FOR YOU A DEVELOPED COUNTRY




1.1 NATIONAL INTERESTS
   Sri Lanka is a Free, Sovereign and Independent Democratic Socialist
   Republic. In other words, the sovereignty of the state lies with its people.

   Whether you are a Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Malay, Burgher, or Vedi, every
   citizen of the republic shares equal ownership and right to rule this state.

   We strongly believe that all development plans and programmes must
   necessarily aim to protect the national interests of the republic.

   PROTECTION OF THE UNITARY STATE
   During the Mahinda Chinthana Decade, separatist terrorism was defeated,
   and the age-old unitary state of the republic was preserved. However, there
   are still some separatist political groups acting against the republic. As it has
   always been, our main policy is to protect the republic from such dangers
   by implementing all necessary security measures.

   A LIFE WITHOUT FEAR
   As much as we secure the republic, we must also ensure the internal
   security of the state. Our policy is to take all necessary measures to protect
   the people so that they can live without fear.

   All state intelligence and security forces will undergo a complete review, and
   any weaknesses identified will be promptly resolved. Suitable personnel
   will be appointed to relevant positions and the safety of the citizens as well
   as the foreigners in Sri Lanka will be assured.

   We will strictly not allow any form of suppression, humiliation or violence
   against any ethnic, religious, or political groups.

   All possible actions will be taken to prevent violence against women or
   children, while the law will be upheld strictly and promptly in all such cases.

   Zero tolerance policy will be applied in the events of terrorism, the
   underworld and narcotics.

   EQUALLY FRIENDLY YET NON-ALIGNED FOREIGN
    POLICY
   Located at a strategically important position along the naval and air routes
   connecting the global East and West, foreign states have always affected
   our country in many ways. And as a relatively small economy exposed to the
   global economy, we are also affected by the international market dynamics.




                                                                                  12
NAMAL VISION



       As always, our policy will be to stand independent without aligning
       ourselves with any foreign state or global camp but keep equally friendly
       international relations with all states.

       Any attempt by any foreign state to intervene in our internal affairs will be
       promptly prevented thereby preserving our independence.

      PROTECTING REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY
       The equal sovereignty held by the citizens of the republic is practically
       realised through Representative Democracy. It is done by electing
       representatives to the legislature and the executive institutions in free and
       fair elections.

       The culture of election corruption and post-election violence which existed
       before 2005 was brought to an end during the Mahinda Chinthana Decade,
       thereby protecting the franchise of the citizens. Our policy is to strengthen
       that freedom even more.

      PROTECTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS
       The Constitution is the social contract which enforces the sovereignty of the
       people, including human rights. Therefore, we are all bound to protect the
       Constitution.

       Any person or group that has been found guilty of violating constitutional
       rights will be brought to justice by upholding the rule of law.

      PROTECTING AND NURTURING THE BUDDHA SASANA
       Our civilisation which has a historical development of over two and a half
       millennia was founded upon the principles of Buddha Dharma. Noble
       values such as equal kindness to all animals, tolerance in both happiness
       and sadness, truthfulness in all cases and even the principles of governance
       such as “Dasa Raja Dharma” are all imparted to us through Buddha Sasana.

       The historical heritage that marvels the visitors and the philosophical
       knowledge base of the Theravada tradition was gifted to the world through
       the Buddha Sasana.

       We shall respect the freedom to hold any religious belief by any citizen not
       just as a constitutional clause but also by the Bauddha principle. We are
       bound to protect the religious freedom of all citizens.




13
                                            FOR YOU A DEVELOPED COUNTRY



To protect and nurture the Buddha Sasana, we plan to enrich the young
monks with Bauddha Philosophy and proficiency in English, French, German,
Korean, and Italian languages in addition to the oriental languages as well
as with Information and Communications Technology. We believe that this
is the way to take the Buddha Dharma to the future world. We plan to train
5,000 monks in the first phase.

Every temple will be completed with the essential facilities while a special
medical insurance scheme has been planned for the elderly monks who
have dedicated their lives to the Sasana. There will also be a special
programme to support the parents of the monks.

Efforts will be made to control the threats to the Tripitaka Dharma and
protect the scripture of Sri Saddharma for future generations.




                                                                          14
NAMAL VISION




1.2 NEW ECONOMIC LEAP
       Below are our policy targets to stabilise the economy and bring about long-
       term economic growth during the next decade.

      GDP TARGET
       Our target for the next decade is to raise Sri Lanka’s Gross Domestic Product
       to over US$ 180 billion. Accordingly, the Per Capita GDP is expected to
       cross the US$ 8,000 boundary.

       The agriculture sector contribution to the GDP will be increased to 10%,
       while we expect the manufacturing sector contribution to move to 25%.
       The largest contribution to the GDP of 65% is planned from the services
       sector in the next decade.

      ACHIEVING POSITIVE TRADE BALANCE
       The difference between the export income and the import expenditure has
       not been positive under any government since 1977. Our policy aims to
       bring it to a positive value within the next decade.

      STRONG FOREIGN RESERVES
       We will raise the currently depleted foreign reserves to be sufficient for
       more than six months of imports to maintain a stable economy and to face
       future emergencies.

      GOVERNMENT REVENUE UP - EXPENDITURE
       CONTROLLED
       Our policies are to maintain financial discipline to cover the annual deficit
       between the government income and expenditure and reduce wastage
       while transparently managing the budget approved at the beginning of
       the year.

       While meeting state revenue targets we will gradually revise the indirect
       taxes on consumer goods and taxes on wages to provide relief to the
       people.

       While increasing the number of individuals and businesses paying income
       tax, the existing number of different types of taxes will be reduced and a
       much simpler tax system will be introduced.

       Government expenditures will be made public and will act to maximise
       efficiency from every rupee spent.




15
                                              FOR YOU A DEVELOPED COUNTRY



 NATIONAL EMERGENCY FUND
 A permanent Rupee Savings Reserve will be built to face events of national
 emergencies. A certain percentage of the annual income will be allocated
 to this fund.

 DEBT-SERVICING ECONOMY
 Our policy target is to gradually reduce public debt to 80% of GDP by
 building an economy capable of repaying all types of loans as quickly as
 possible.

 A country with a small economy like ours has to borrow in a planned
 manner for development activities that the people expect. However, such
 developments should essentially accrue benefits to the people. People have
 already received significant benefits from the infrastructure built during the
 Mahinda Chinthana Decade. Our policy is to continuously develop those
 assets and generate benefits more effectively.

 STABLE RUPEE
 Our policy is to maintain the rupee at a stable value against the dollar
 through the growth of GDP, remittances, and tourism earnings along with
 effective management of the trade balance and foreign debt.

 SOLUTION TO UNEMPLOYMENT
 The sustainable solution to the economic crisis is to provide high-paying
 job opportunities to our workforce. The lowest unemployment rate in our
 history (4%) was recorded during the Mahinda Chinthana Decade. Job
 creation and workforce training is one of our key economic policies for the
 next decade.

 Priority will be given to provide jobs in highly demanded sectors such as
 but not limited to Health, Construction, Education and Training, Software
 Engineering, Data Analytics, Cyber Security, e-commerce, Product Design,
 Digital Design Marketing, and to provide tax concessions and investment
 facilities for job-creating businesses and relevant training institutions.

 Our target is to reduce the number of unemployed people in the labour
 force to less than 2%, while not letting the underemployed rate reach
 higher than a low single digit. Arrangements will be made to provide job
 opportunities to all the graduates.




                                                                             16
NAMAL VISION



       Since one of our priorities is to increase the remittance income and to give
       Sri Lankan workers the global experience, we will prioritise directing them to
       high-level foreign jobs. Also, arrangements will be made for internationally
       recognised skills certifications necessary for local jobseekers to secure jobs
       abroad.

      INFLATION AT LOWER SINGLE DIGIT
       The YoY economic growth rate will be maintained at an average of 7%,
       while a comprehensive strategic action plan will be implemented to reduce
       the increase in cost of living.

      POLICY RATES AT SINGLE DIGIT
       Our policy target is to maintain interest rates at a single-digit value through
       budget deficit management and the growth of GDP.

1.3 AMONG THE TOP 50 IN SOCIAL
    PROGRESSION
   The internationally recognised method to measure the social development
   of a country is the United Nations, Human Development Index (HDI).

   HDI is based on three key social aspects namely, Health, Education and
   Standard of Living. Sri Lanka has always been ahead in terms of social
   development because of the free health and free education policies
   supplemented by wide social security programmes.

   Sri Lanka is currently ranked 78th out of 193 countries and belongs to the
   “high” human development category in the world. The highest growth in
   this regard occurred during the Mahinda Chinthana Decade.

   Our policy target is to enter the “Very High” category and be among the
   first 50 countries in the next decade. Our main social development policy
   targets are as follows:

   HEALTHY AND SAFE LIVES
   A high value of life expectancy at birth, which is the main measure of
   people's health, shows that a country's health policy and its standards are
   at a high level.

   The main reasons for the already high life expectancy in Sri Lanka are free
   health services, balanced work-life and the natural environment which is
   less polluted than many other countries.

   It is our main policy to develop targeted public healthcare facilities in such
   a way that the life expectancy in Sri Lanka will grow from 74 to 76 years for
   men and 80 to 82 years for women in the next decade.

   NEW AGE EDUCATION
   Proper education is essential for the development of a society. The ethical
   thinking required for a civilised society and the scientific knowledge, and
   technical skills required for economic growth are acquired through formal
   education and applied learning.

   It is our main policy to update and expand opportunities for formal
   education by innovating syllabi, teaching methods and teaching media to
   achieve these objectives.

   To achieve the HDI target we will work to increase the average time spent
   in formal education in school as well as after leaving school.



                                                                               18
NAMAL VISION



       This does not mean that the time spent in school will be extended. This
       means increasing the total time spent in formal education even after leaving
       school and while working. The more time spent in formal education, the
       more successful individuals become.

      DECENT LIVING STANDARD
       The third aspect of social development is the standard of living of the
       people. Access to clean and nutritious food, health, liveable housing,
       decent job opportunities, entertainment and security are the hallmarks of a
       high standard of living.

       The higher the per capita Gross National Income, the higher the standard
       of living of the people. Therefore, in the next decade, efforts will be made
       to raise the per capita gross national income to the level of a developed
       country. This correlates with the above economic growth targets.




19
                                                    FOR YOU A DEVELOPED COUNTRY




1.4 ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
   The environment, including clean air, lush greenery, clean water, fertile soil
   and wildlife, is the beating heart of any country. Therefore, the environment
   should be protected and enhanced, while limiting pollution.

   Just as human activities have negative effects on the environment, those
   effects will in turn have negative effects on humans.

   Emissions from the burning of fossil fuels to generate energy for industry
   and transportation have increased the global temperature and drastically
   changed the climate. This is the reason for the irregularity of the natural
   rains. It has already caused major issues for traditional farming and people's
   everyday lives.

   Therefore, economic growth and social development should be done while
   minimising the damage to ecological sustainability. If not, all development
   will be in vain like the house that you built getting swept away by the flood.

   OPTIMISING NATURAL RESOURCES
   With a relatively small land area, Sri Lanka has limited natural resources. We
   so far haven’t found any fossil fuels like coal, crude oil or gas. Therefore,
   it is our main policy to make more use of our natural resources such as
   water, sunlight and wind to generate the necessary energy to achieve the
   above economic and social development goals. This will gradually reduce
   our dependence on fossil fuel imports.

   The soil is becoming barren in some areas due to over-cultivation for a long
   time. It is our policy to constantly maintain soil fertility to increase agricultural
   output essential for the above economic and social development goals.

   Many farmers did not approve of the measures taken to prevent the use
   of synthetic fertiliser and agrochemicals that contain toxins harmful to the
   human body. We have also stated above that agricultural production will be
   increased for economic growth targets. Therefore, it may not be possible to
   prevent the use of synthetic chemicals at present.

   There is a risk of rapid depletion of underground mineral resources such as
   gems, graphite, quartz, mineral sand, limestone, phosphate, and sea sand.
   Steps will be taken to carry out mining industries in a more formal and
   environmentally friendly manner so that these resources can be maintained
   over a long period.

   One of the most valuable natural resources on the surface of Sri Lanka is our
   forest cover. It is one of the reasons for the high health status of the people
   as it contributes to the clean air which we all breathe. Therefore, our policy
   is to optimise the already used lands more efficiently without clearing more
   forests simply for the sake of economic growth.


                                                                                      20
NAMAL VISION



      MINIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE
       We have stated above that industrial production will be increased as per
       the economic growth targets. This will increase the production of industrial
       waste which will pollute the environment even more.

       Therefore, investment priority will be given to innovations that can minimise
       the solid, liquid and gaseous waste emitted by industries.

       Due to plastic waste, the rivers, canals, dams, and oceans around the country
       have been heavily polluted. As a result, the water has become unsuitable
       not only for human consumption but also for marine animals. As a result,
       tourism attraction is also lost, adversely affecting the economy.

       Therefore, investments will be made in innovative enterprises that can
       produce environmentally friendly substitutes for plastics, and in innovative
       waste management and recycling businesses.

      ANIMAL WELFARE
       Animals also share the same Earth that humans live in. So, we recognise
       their right to the natural environment and will guarantee their rights.

       It is our policy to protect endangered animals. Wildlife is a major tourist
       attraction in Sri Lanka. Therefore, economic and social activity will be done in
       such a way as not to harm the natural environment where those animals live.

       Instead of putting animals' lives at risk, investments will be made in
       innovations that can solve the issue of crop damage from wild animals.

       A joint mechanism with anti-cruelty organisations will be set up for the
       protection of free-living, abandoned and injured animals.

      APPROVALS FOR DEVELOPMENT
       Investment-led development projects need to be implemented in the
       country for the economic growth expected by the people. Often the
       obstacle in such cases is the time and cost of environmental reports and
       approvals.

       Therefore, relevant government services will be integrated using ICT in
       such a way that environmental standards and recommendations that can be
       practically met by investors are designed and made available in advance,
       which will then be checked and approved rapidly.

      CARBON CREDIT
       Compared to some other countries, Sri Lanka has a low carbon footprint.
       We believe that Sri Lanka deserves specific benefits from the big polluters
       of the world. A special mechanism will be implemented in this regard at the
       diplomatic level.


21
2. INNOVATION
NAMAL VISION




2.1 PUBLIC SECTOR OPTIMISATION
       To achieve the goals of integrated development, the entire political system,
       including the public service, will be adapted to international standards and
       will be modernised in a manner suitable for the 21st century.

      E-GOVERNANCE
       The easiest and fastest way to implement many different interrelated sectors
       is to connect them using an electronic system. It will provide facilities for
       real-time information exchange between government institutions in digital
       mode.

       For that, modern and incorruptible software with international security
       standards will be developed and installed to cover the entire public service
       delivery network.

       Public services will be made easier and faster by installing the Electronic
       National Identity Card system that includes biometric data. There will be
       no need to repeatedly provide the information of the concerned person to
       each institution, thereafter.

       This will avoid the waste of time and money caused by people coming to
       Colombo from distant areas for every service requirement. The opportunity
       will be provided to receive those services in their own area, and within
       a year most of these services will be available to be received from the
       convenience at home.

       Also, people will be able to get accurate and real-time data and information
       transparently about public affairs.

       For the success of this process, public servants will be trained, and their
       services will be made technologically efficient.

      NO SALE OF STATE ENTERPRISES
       It is not our policy to sell public assets including state enterprises. It is
       our policy to create profits and benefits for the people and workers by
       innovating and streamlining the processes of state-owned lands, natural
       resources and enterprises.

       For that, Entrepreneurial Executive Boards will be appointed to carry out
       planned organisational change projects with specific targets.

       Facilitation will be provided to coordinate the local private sector for the
       necessary capital and technical support.




23
                                               FOR YOU A DEVELOPED COUNTRY



 END OF FRAUD AND CORRUPTION SLOGAN
 Some people have been making accusations for a long time that there
 is fraud and corruption in government administration and public service.
 But it seems that they only misuse it as a political slogan without actually
 working to prove the allegations. It only hinders the prevention of real fraud
 and corruption.

 Therefore, an ICT-based procurement system of international standards, an
 open and competitive bidding system, a modern tax system and a formal
 investment mechanism in line with the corporate sector will be set up
 with full transparency. The methods will be developed as appropriate for
 each sector. Necessary amendments and new laws will be passed for this
 purpose.

 A parliamentary committee consisting of MPs from the main opposition
 political parties will be formed to scrutinise and certify all proposed capital
 expenditures before approving them. This will prevent fraud or corruption
 before it happens.

 FORENSIC AUDIT OF ALL LOANS
 A forensic audit of all the loans taken for infrastructure and human
 development in the past will be undertaken and the report will be openly
 published.

 This will include the long-term development loans taken at low interest
 from multilateral organisations such as the World Bank and the Asian
 Development Bank, and the bilateral loans taken at low interest from
 countries such as India, Japan and China.

 Also, a forensic audit will be conducted on how the money obtained
 through International Sovereign Bonds at high interest was used, and that
 report will also be openly published.

 STATE BALANCE SHEET
 The market value of the physical and human resources developed thus far
 and the public money, loans, grants and direct investments that were used
 for such developments will be assessed to prepare a Balance Sheet for the
 State.

 Thereby, people will get an up-to-date understanding of the assets and
 liabilities of the state.




                                                                              24
NAMAL VISION



      HIGH-QUALITY PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
       The public administrative service is one of the fundamental pillars on
       which the success of a state depends. It will be modernised according to
       international standards.

       An ICT-based Public Service Performance Management System based on
       360-degree feedback from the people, employees, and political leadership
       will be set up promptly.

       All administrative service officers will be continuously trained to provide
       high-quality services to the people using modern technology.

       Permanent Secretaries will be appointed for the necessary government
       bodies for the consistent implementation of these policies for a long period.

      UNINTERRUPTED FREE HEALTHCARE
       A modern ICT system will be installed linking all government hospitals to
       provide high-quality healthcare services easily and efficiently.

       Through this, information such as patient test reports and drug prescriptions
       will be formally and securely filed and can be accessed by the doctors at
       any time using the Electronic National Identity Card.

       This will avoid queues and congestion caused by frequent visits to the
       hospital.

       Under the “Active Nation” programme, sports will be promoted to improve
       the physical fitness of school and university students as well as public and
       private sector employees.

       Drug production, procurement and distribution will be completely
       transformed, fraud, corruption and waste will be reduced, and medicines
       will be provided at affordable prices to the people.

       Private hospital services often reduce the pressure on government
       healthcare. Therefore, taxes on health services will be revised accordingly
       thereby reducing the private healthcare charges.

       In competitive lifestyles, there is a high tendency to develop mental illnesses
       such as stress. Therefore, mental health services will be expanded while
       promoting work-life balance.




25
                                             FOR YOU A DEVELOPED COUNTRY



 CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR ALL
 Every person has an equal right to clean drinking water. Sri Lanka has
 already made great progress in drinking water supply, but a comprehensive
 programme will be implemented to continuously meet the drinking water
 needs of every person living in any area under any weather conditions in
 the future.

 STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN EDUCATION
 We aspire to create a balanced citizen through teaching subjects of Science,
 Technology, English, Mathematics, Mother Language, Religion, Arts and
 Entrepreneurship.

 All education syllabi in primary, secondary and tertiary sectors will be
 reviewed within one year and upgraded to suit the market and social needs
 of today and future world. All these activities will be done quickly and at a
 low cost using ICT.

 A “Smart Education” methodology which also uses Artificial Intelligence
 will be introduced from school to university.

 All schoolteachers, university lecturers and career counsellors will receive
 continuous professional training. An ICT-based system will be introduced
 to manage their performance, and an additional bonus will be added to the
 salary based on their measured target achievements.

 Both public and private schools will be subjected to international
 standardisation.

 The field of professional training and skills development will be further
 strengthened to meet international employment qualification requirements.

 A university development programme will be implemented to bring Sri
 Lanka's state universities to the top of the international rankings, and the
 university courses will be adjusted to suit the global job market to resolve
 the issue of unemployed graduates.

 A National Higher Education Commission will be set up to regulate state and
 non-state universities and other degree-granting institutions to maintain
 the standard of all degree courses.

 A special system will be implemented under the Ministry of Education to
 regulate large-scale private tuition-class education.




                                                                            26
NAMAL VISION



      INNOCENT CHILDREN
       Children are the future heirs of the nation. They shape the future of our
       country. Therefore, our irrevocable responsibility today is to provide the
       children with balanced nutrition, a sound mentality, a winning personality
       and a virtuous character.

       Arrangements will be made to provide Triposha and necessary vitamins
       to pregnant mothers and newborn children through the village child and
       maternity clinic.

       Children from low-income families will be provided with a subsidy for
       preschool education through Samurdhi.

       Mothers working abroad, fathers being drunk or addicted to drugs, and
       parents divorcing or living apart, leaving their children helpless and
       insecure, is a growing tragedy in the country. A Foster Parent system will
       be introduced to provide the necessary care and facilities to such children.

       Donors living in the country and abroad will be encouraged to provide
       monthly support to such children. With such aid, a closely monitored work
       assignment will be implemented in which the mothers of the Samurdhi
       families who volunteer in the respective villages will be entitled to a stipend
       for preparing food for and taking care of the children.

       The school lunch programme will be expanded to children of all ages.

      WOMEN TO THE FOREFRONT
       A programme will be implemented to allow every woman who wants to
       earn income but is not engaged in a permanent job. Women will be given
       priority for small and medium-scale industries and food manufacturing
       industries. Women will be given equal opportunities for direct and indirect
       income generation programmes in the production zones that will be
       developed near their village.

       A hotline number and a mobile application will be introduced to call
       when a woman is in danger or trying to get help including psychological
       counselling.

      ARMED FORCES AND POLICE
       The responsibility and obligation of the armed forces, police and civil
       defence forces is to protect the constitution and democratic institutions of
       the state. It is our policy to provide them with the leadership and facilities
       they need to do their service without any inconvenience.




27
                                               FOR YOU A DEVELOPED COUNTRY



 For that, all military and police stations in the country will be modernised
 and hostel facilities will be improved. The armed forces headquarters built
 by us will be completed.

 At least one female police officer will be positioned for each village and
 10,000 new policewomen will be recruited for this purpose.

 A museum and a library will be established for future generations to
 learn about the humanitarian war against terrorism that hindered the
 development of this country for 30 years. It will be open to local as well as
 foreign tourists.

 Modern knowledge and training of international standards will be
 continuously imparted to enhance efficiency in all security forces.

 A modern ICT-based methodology and system will be established to control
 traffic violations. An application will be introduced so that fines can be paid
 at the scene of the offence.

 FOR THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS
 Brothers and sisters with special needs living in our society will be provided
 with all essential facilities, income-generating opportunities and equal
 treatment as per international standards.

 NEW MEANING FOR SAMURDHI
 The Samurdhi programme, which provides financial relief to low-income
 earners, will continue as before with improvements.

 A special community programme will be implemented at the village level,
 involving the Samurdhi receivers with tailored benefits.

 The outstanding salary issues and other problems of the Samurdhi
 Development Officers, who contribute greatly to the strengthening of the
 Samurdhi Movement, will be resolved immediately.

 RESPECTING THE RETIRED STATE EMPLOYEES
 Sri Lanka's population is ageing rapidly. To achieve the above development
 goals, an integrated programme will be implemented to supplement the
 young workforce with the able retired community.

 A Voluntary Service Pool will be established where senior citizens who can
 continue serving will be entitled to a monthly stipend. Depending on the
 residence of its members, the opportunity will be given to perform public
 support services or similar community services in government institutions
 frequented by the public.


                                                                              28
NAMAL VISION



       The pension scheme will be enhanced to match the current inflation rates.
       Higher interest than the market average interest on their fixed deposits
       will be given to all senior citizens, while the current insurance schemes and
       other privileges will also be increased.

      MODERN DISASTER MANAGEMENT
       The Meteorological Department will be equipped with the latest ICT
       services and other technologies for accurate forecasting which is essential
       to reduce the loss of life and property due to floods and landslides.

       All the necessary facilities will be provided in advance to the areas where a
       risk of natural disaster is identified.

      YOUTH-LED SOCIAL INNOVATION
       A community of young people will be organised who can create innovative
       solutions for Sri Lanka's social issues and have the interest and commitment
       to take those solutions to society.

       This group of volunteers will implement unique programmes such as
       increasing the political participation of youth, implementing the active
       nation programme, environmental protection projects, acting on animal
       safety, and developing of positive attitude among the youth.

       This community that will innovatively solve economic, social and
       environmental problems from the national level to the grassroots level of
       the village and city will be connected with international youth organisations
       to gain international knowledge and experience.

       A contributory savings scheme will be introduced to cover the cost of their
       wedding ceremony which is one of the special dreams of the youth.

2.2 TRANSFORMATION OF THE
    AGRICULTURE SECTOR
   The primary sector of the economy including agriculture, fisheries, livestock
   and forestry will be transformed to produce US$ 18 billion per year over
   the next decade.

   AGRO-MODERNISATION
   Water, seeds and fertiliser will be provided to cultivate all arable land.

   By setting a guaranteed price scheme for grains including paddy, the
   farmer's return on investment will be secured.

   Modern technical methods that can increase yields will be introduced to all
   fields of cultivation including continuous training on their use.

   Farmer Cooperatives will be empowered to manage the entire process
   from the production and supply of high-yielding seeds to the sale of crops.

   The division between major and minor export crops used in the past is
   no longer relevant today. The reason for this is that the foreign exchange
   brought by crops such as cinnamon, pepper, and cardamom are closely
   competing with the major export crops such as tea, coconut and rubber.
   Therefore, such crops will be reclassified as major export crops. Accordingly,
   all the subsidies and other privileges given to the main export crops will be
   given to those crops as well.

   Farmers will be advised in advance on the quantities of vegetables and
   fruits to be produced according to the market demand and seasons to
   mitigate the wastage of crops and to maintain stable prices.

   Surplus harvests will be identified, and supply chains will be connected for
   export. Cold and dry storage facilities will be developed for this purpose.

   A permanent solution to the wage dispute between the tea estate owners
   and the workers will be provided with the agreement of all parties.

   Facilities including land will be provided to double the coconut and king
   coconut harvests in the next decade and arrangements will be made for
   export after meeting the local requirement.

   Rubber cultivation and production will be maintained steadily.

   Cut flowers and betel leaf production will be doubled in the next decade
   and export support will be provided.

   The contribution of the agricultural research and production support
   officials will be enhanced by equipping them with ICT skills and tools.


                                                                                30
NAMAL VISION



       Crops will be imported only as per the need to maintain a reasonable price
       that is affordable to the people while giving priority to local production.

       Investments will be made in agricultural innovations that can achieve high
       yields without polluting soil and water.

      OCEAN ECONOMY REVOLUTION
       Determining the maritime boundary of Sri Lanka in 2007 was a great
       achievement for us. The United Nations has accepted the request of
       President Mahinda Rajapaksa regarding the extension of our country's sea
       boundary and has calculated that the extent of the ocean we are entitled
       to is more than twenty times the land of Sri Lanka. Efforts will be made to
       resolve this pending matter as soon as possible.

       Marine pharmaceutical products, fish and marine plant-based industries
       will be encouraged with strategic investments.

       The canoes and boats still used by most of our fishing community for
       short-distance fishing are unsafe. Therefore, in-country manufacturing of
       vessels with communication and storage facilities will be supported for the
       convenience of fishermen.

       The Ocean University of Sri Lanka will be used to offer international standard
       training courses and degrees in marine engineering technology aimed at
       the shipping and logistics job market.

       Natural currents and fisheries will be continuously studied, and a new map
       of fish resources and seaways will be created.

       A sales-oriented programme will be implemented to find new markets
       to face the challenges that arise regarding the sale of fish harvest in the
       international market.

       An investment loan scheme for the development of fish-related value-
       adding industries such as mackerel, dried fish and pickle will be provided
       especially to women entrepreneurs.

       To develop the freshwater fish industry in the country, a comprehensive
       programme will be implemented using the inland reservoirs.

      ANIMAL INDUSTRIES
       Large-scale industries raising animals for milk, eggs and meat will be
       encouraged to be more humane in their process.

       Backyard rearing of poultry and other animals will be facilitated as an
       opportunity to earn an additional monthly income, especially for the village
       households.

       Maize cultivation for animal feed will be expanded.

2.3 MANUFACTURING SECTOR VALUE
    CREATION
   The production industries of the secondary sector of the economy will add
   a value of US$ 45 billion per year to the country's economy in the next
   decade.

   HIGH-PRECISION TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURING
   Sri Lankan workers have a special talent for high-precision manufacturing.
   A policy and practical programme will be set up with international
   stakeholders and investors to utilise this capability to produce modern
   technology products for the global market.

   The programme will integrate technology and investment facilities, global
   market access, and strategic international partners.

   Small and medium-sized technology manufacturing industries that are
   already operating, such as electronics manufacturing, will be linked to
   create regional manufacturing clusters and provided with the necessary
   technology, investment and global market access to upgrade to high-
   precision products.

   The necessary technology, investment and market facilities for the
   establishment and expansion of large-scale global manufacturing industries
   will be done by redesigning the local regulatory and legal frameworks to
   meet international requirements.

   Priority will be given to this new manufacturing sector in achieving the
   above economic goals.

   ENERGY PRODUCTION FOR EXPORT
   It is our policy to make Sri Lanka a regional centre for renewable energy
   export. Large-scale investments will be made to harness, store and export
   electricity produced from renewable energy sources such as hydro, solar,
   wind and green hydrogen to neighbouring countries.

   CHEMICALS AND PHARMACEUTICALS TO
    INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS
   Necessary support will be provided to expand the production of
   international-grade chemicals using domestic and imported raw materials.

   Investments will be made to develop Sri Lanka into a regional centre
   for pharmaceuticals and other health products manufacturing through
   automation technology adaptation.


                                                                           32
NAMAL VISION



      SUSTAINABLE MINERAL INDUSTRIES
       Mining and extraction of underground natural resources such as gems,
       graphite, quartz, mineral sand, limestone, phosphate, sea sand etc. will be
       facilitated with the help of the most effective and modern technology which
       causes the least harm to the environment.

       By adding value to domestic and imported minerals and selling them at
       a higher price in the international market, we will double the revenue of
       mineral-related products in the next decade.

      CONSTRUCTION SECTOR BOOST
       Taxes on products required to immediately activate the lagging construction
       sector will be revised. The construction sector output over the next decade
       will be doubled.

       The construction and development of Colombo Port City will be accelerated
       and prioritised as a project of national importance.

       Construction of highways and other roads which are currently stalled will
       recommence immediately.

       Priority will be given to more efficient construction materials and
       technologies.

       Loan interest will be reduced for the construction of houses, offices and
       business premises.

      FOOD AND BEVERAGE PRODUCT REVOLUTION
       Food and beverage production, one of Sri Lanka's main manufacturing
       sectors, will be set to grow by 50% in the next decade. We will facilitate
       the informal sector producing food and beverages to move into the formal
       economy.

       Sri Lanka's traditional food industry will be promoted while research will be
       encouraged for new food and beverage products.

       Fast food products based on rice and other cereals and methods of
       preserving vegetables and fruits will be encouraged.

       The production of flavoured teas and local herbal drinks will be expanded.

       Spices, oils and other plant extract production will be set to double in the
       next decade.

       Local sugar production will be doubled, and facilities will be provided for
       coconut production aimed at the export market.


33
                                             FOR YOU A DEVELOPED COUNTRY



 Research facilities, quality testing, approvals and certification procedures
 for food and beverage innovation will be streamlined and expedited.

 International food manufacturing standards will be implemented across
 the sector with a focus on the export market and tourism.

 OPTIMISATION OF APPAREL MANUFACTURING
 Huge investments have been made in Sri Lanka's apparel and textile
 industries for a long time. Therefore, all necessary steps will be taken to
 develop the sector and get the maximum benefits. Facilities will be provided
 to double the production of footwear and clothing in the next decade.

 The government will provide facilities to reduce production costs while
 encouraging investors to develop related industries thereby creating new
 jobs and factories in different provinces of the country.

 The quality of work and life of the apparel sector employees will be
 enhanced.

 Investment will be provided for local textile manufacturing.

 ECONOMIC ZONES ALONG THE EXPRESSWAYS
 New Manufacturing Zones will be built targeting areas with major entrances
 and exits for expressways to spread economic growth throughout the island.




                                                                           34
NAMAL VISION




2.4 INNOVATION IN THE SERVICE SECTOR
       For Sri Lanka's GDP in the next decade, the tertiary sector will contribute
       US$ 117 billion per year.

      TRAVEL, TRADE, TRANSIT CENTRE
       One of our main strategies is to make Sri Lanka not just a destination, but
       one of the busiest tourist centres in the region. An advanced technological
       environment with modern facilities will be created to attract all types of
       travellers, travelling not only on holidays but also for business meetings
       and international conferences.

       A high-quality promotional plan will be implemented to make Sri Lanka
       one of the world's most popular tourist destinations in the next decade.

       With the end of the war, Sri Lanka became a paradise for foreign tourists.
       The Mahinda Chinthana target of 2 million passenger service per year was
       achieved by 2019 but drastically fell as a result of the Easter Sunday Attack.
       We will increase that number to 5 million travellers per year in the next
       decade. While increasing the number of tourist arrivals we will also increase
       the average time they spend in the country and increase the amount they
       spend during that time.

       The Mattala International Airport was built because the Katunayake Airport
       would not be sufficient for the arrival of those additional tourists. Therefore,
       Mattala Airport will be developed as planned by attracting more tourists.
       A modern electronic system will be installed to facilitate and speed up the
       entire process from airport check-in to departure, and arrival to exit.

       The necessary infrastructure will be improved to develop the marine tourism
       industry.

       Special investment and credit facilities will be provided for the construction
       of large and small hotels and domestic accommodation facilities with the
       extra rooms needed for the above tourists.

       In addition to the existing well-known destinations, 10 new tourist
       attractions and many new tourist experiences will be created across the
       island and facilities will be provided to organise international festivals and
       conferences.

       Domestic flight services connecting Mattala and Jaffna Airports will be
       expanded to further match international flight schedules so that they can
       reach their destinations quickly.




35
                                               FOR YOU A DEVELOPED COUNTRY



 Tourists will be encouraged to purchase goods by reimbursing the Value
 Added Tax on goods purchased at the time of departure.

 A contributory pension scheme will be introduced for tour guides.

 FUTURE-PROOFING THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
 20-30% of the economy currently takes place outside of the banking system.
 It is unsafe for the entrepreneurs as well as the customers and is also harmful
 to the state economy. Therefore, we will introduce the necessary regulations
 and facilities to bring 90% of the total transactions into the banking system.

 To reduce the use of coins and notes, bank cards and mobile wallets will be
 promoted.

 Intelligence units will be deployed to detect fraudulent financial transactions.
 Fraudsters identified will be strictly prosecuted.

 New investment programmes will be introduced for the development of rural
 entrepreneurship. The cooperative banking system will be strengthened
 with a focus on providing student loans and youth entrepreneurship credit
 facilities.

 HEALING HAVEN
 Sri Lanka will be developed into one of the world's leading health and
 wellness service centres. Public and private integrated investments will be
 made to build the world's most advanced private hospitals in the country.

 Sri Lanka's private healthcare sector, which is already at a high standard,
 will be facilitated to provide services to foreigners in a more formal manner.

 Sinhala Traditional Medicine and Ayurvedic Medicine, which have been
 healing people since time immemorial, will be promoted and brought to
 an international standard through strategic investment.

 EDUCATION SERVICES CENTRE
 We will develop Sri Lanka as a peaceful International Education Centre free
 from the dangers of escalating wars and conflicts spreading in the rest of
 the world by building state-of-the-art education facilities in some of the
 most beautiful areas in Sri Lanka.

 Accordingly, Sri Lanka will be set to recruit more than 10,000 foreign
 students per year over the next decade.




                                                                               36
NAMAL VISION



       We will also expand the residential facilities, recruit high-quality teaching
       staff and researchers from home and abroad and create a safe environment
       for foreign students.

       By doing so, it will be possible to earn additional foreign revenue and
       reduce foreign currency leaving the country.

      CREATING THE CREATOR ECONOMY
       Creating, editing and distributing audio-visual content to a large audience
       through various social media is a competitive global service sector today.
       Such content creators in Sri Lanka will be provided with regulatory and
       financial facilities to scale their services.

      SRI LANKAN ARTS TO THE CULTURAL WORLD
       Art is a unique way of expressing the culture of a country. We will turn Sri
       Lanka into a Cultural Export Centre which nurtures our ancient art forms
       and takes them to the international market with modernity. We will support
       the development of Sri Lankan artists including songs, music, dance and
       acting to reach new global audiences.

       Therefore, Sri Lankan artists will be able to gain international recognition
       and make their artworks of higher quality.

      RETAIL TRADE REVAMP
       Steps will be taken to develop the FMCG and household appliances trades
       to a higher standard. For that, the Consumer Affairs Authority will be re-
       engineered to suit current and future needs.

       Small shops and their supply chains will be supported with investment
       attached to training to grow their income.

       Import restrictions and tariffs on clothing, footwear, fashion and jewellery
       will be revised to attract tourist customers by developing the trade to
       international standards.

       The government services required for the promotion of land, houses, flats
       and vehicle trade will be formalised with the use of ICT systems.

       All types of restaurants and entertainment services like movie theatres will
       be supported to be upgraded. Small restaurants will be facilitated with
       investments attached to training to bring them up to formal and hygienic
       standards.




37
                                               FOR YOU A DEVELOPED COUNTRY



 Places like the Petah Market, Regional Economic Centres and Sati Pola will
 be renovated to a respectful standard for traders, workers and consumers.

 Government regulations will be modernised to increase consumer
 confidence to promote e-Commerce.

 A simpler and transparent tax system will be introduced for goods imported
 from abroad.

 TRANSPORT SERVICES UPGRADATION
 The fact that the island-wide road network, including expressways built
 during the Mahinda Chinthana Decade, is still in good condition proves
 their highest quality.

 But the transport service has not improved compared to the roads. It has
 been over 50 years since transportation was privatised, but private buses
 have yet to modernise.

 Private buses are often seen being driven irresponsibly putting the
 passengers and the pedestrians at risk. The comfort of the passengers
 travelling in them is not up to the expected standards. This is a hindrance to
 a dignified standard of living.

 Therefore, new licenses and credit facilities will be provided to gradually
 phase out old buses and import only modern and comfortable buses of
 international standards.

 Licenses of errant bus drivers will be suspended, and new licenses will be
 issued only after proper counselling and driving training and testing.

 A complete innovation will be done in the railways in the next decade. New
 trains will be deployed to double the productivity of the existing railways,
 and the train timetable and ticketing process will be done entirely through
 an ICT system.

 Transport of goods on roads increases traffic congestion. Therefore, facilities
 will be provided for more use of railways for transportation of goods.

 New railways will be built parallel to selected expressways.

 Also, passenger and cargo transportation services will be expanded by
 connecting the seaports located around the island.

 Sri Lanka will be further developed as an international maritime transport
 and service centre.




                                                                              38
NAMAL VISION



      IT-BPM TO THE NEXT LEVEL
       With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), traditional jobs
       in the IT and Business Process Management (IT-BPM) sector are rapidly
       changing.

       Therefore, the local companies will be supported to transform into futuristic
       service product delivery modes built on Artificial Intelligence technology.

      LEAP FORWARD SPORTS ECONOMY
       By developing Sri Lanka’s sports as a service sector of international
       standards, it can be placed as a revenue-generating sector.

       Therefore, facilities will be provided for the development of recreational
       sports, competitive sports and electronic sports as services.

       A fair and systematic process will be introduced from the school level to the
       national level to produce professional and disciplined athletes and players
       who can win trophies and medals.

       Thereby, creating an active population as well as sports personalities of
       international excellence.




39
3. INVESTMENT
NAMAL VISION



All the above innovations require strategic investments to achieve the
development goals of the next decade. Therefore, we will introduce a
Public Private Integrated Investment mechanism in this regard.

An investment is not always an expense. An investment is any
expenditure incurred to build an asset that can generate income in the
future. For example, building expressways generates revenue. So, it is
an investment.

Certain expenses are not investments. The expenses incurred for the
day-to-day operations of an organisation do not generate income.

Therefore, it is important to distinguish between investments and
expenses.

3.1 CAPITAL FOR ENTREPRENEURS
       Inventions and Innovations alone don’t become commercially successful
       enterprises. Entrepreneurship is the production of innovative goods and
       services to meet specific market needs.

       The economy of any state develops because of their entrepreneurs. But
       they have to take risks for that.

       Therefore, arrangements will be made to provide the necessary capital
       and other facilities for the development of local entrepreneurs. Integrated
       investment programmes will be introduced from startups to large-scale
       enterprises in targeted sectors.

       In addition to commercial banks, LKR 10 billion of investments per annum
       will be done through cooperative banks in an enterprise development
       model.

       Facilities will be provided for business creation between foreign and local
       entrepreneurs.

       New Acts and facilities will be provided to increase investment opportunities
       through private equity investment as well as the stock market.

       A Social Impact Investment Fund of LKR 1 billion will be introduced to
       support Social Entrepreneurs who solve social and environmental issues
       through entrepreneurial solutions. This will reduce the expenses borne
       by the government because the social enterprises solve part of the issues
       which otherwise the government will have to resolve.




41
                                              FOR YOU A DEVELOPED COUNTRY



   Barriers to increasing foreign investment will be removed. Necessary
   mechanisms will be developed to make those investments transparently
   and formally.

   Domestic enterprise products will be actively linked with international
   market supply chains.

3.2 HUMAN RESOURCE ENRICHMENT
   For all the above developments, it is essential to continuously improve the
   human resources of this country.

   Due to the decrease in the population growth rate in Sri Lanka, the youth
   community is decreasing rapidly compared to the aged community. This is
   a hindrance to the expansion of production capacity required to achieve
   the above economic goals.

   Therefore, population growth will be properly managed, and investments
   will be made in nutrition and health to keep the population healthy for a
   long time.

   A special programme will be introduced to protect professional dignity
   with incentives to get the services of essential experts for the country to
   meet the above development targets.

   Investments will be made in developing all sports and physical fitness from
   the school level to the national level to produce healthy citizens of mind
   and body.

   Investments will be made in programmes that can develop the formal
   education, skills and attitudes necessary for rapid economic growth.

   Investments will be made in the development of religious and cultural
   aspects essential for a dignified standard of living.

   A special programme will be introduced to make the incarcerated workers
   contribute more to the economic process.

3.3 RESEARCH FOR COMMERCIAL VALUE
   Scientific research should be done constantly to innovate for the sake of
   development. Therefore, investments will be made in research for new
   products that can be successful in target market segments and for upgrading
   existing products to a higher standard.




                                                                            42
NAMAL VISION



       Investments will be made to create a thriving research culture that will
       link private-sector research institutions in addition to universities and
       government research institutions.

       The intellectual property rights for the new knowledge and products
       generated by such research will be available to the government in
       proportion to the investments which will in turn earn consistent revenue.

3.4 INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE
       Both physical and soft infrastructure will be developed for local, regional
       and international interconnectivity.

       Katunayake, Mattala, Jaffna, Ratmalana and other Airports, as well as
       Colombo, Hambantota, and Trincomalee Sea Ports, will be developed over
       the next 15 years to service 80 million passengers per year.

       The transport system will be improved and completed to international
       standards including high-quality sanitary facilities.

       Investments will be made in housing construction following the policy of
       providing safe housing to every citizen.

       Priority will be given to the planning of towns and villages, the design and
       construction of new towns, and the construction of offices and factories
       related to the above economic targets.

       All government buildings constructed in the next decade will be designed
       and constructed per advanced techniques to suit modern and future climate
       conditions, with minimum maintenance costs and in an environmentally
       friendly manner.

       Through the integration of all such constructions, the wastage of resources
       and time will be minimised.

       Investments will be made to meet the country's energy needs from
       renewable sources so that electricity can be continuously supplied to
       reduce fuel imports and environmental pollution.

       Investments will be made in modern software and hardware to enable
       them to be installed and run safely and continuously to bring public sector
       services up to international standards.




43
4. FREEDOM
NAMAL VISION



Freedom is to think, speak and act as one pleases. Every citizen has
equal freedom. Therefore, while enjoying one's freedom, one should
do it in such a way that it does not interfere with the freedom of another.

People should be given the freedom to make all the above
developments, innovations and investments successfully. And through
those developments, the freedom of the people will be strengthened
in return.

4.1 EXPANDING ECONOMIC FREEDOM
       The fastest growth of Sri Lanka's economic freedom took place after the
       end of the war against terrorism during the Mahinda Chinthana Decade.

       Our policy is to expand economic freedom to allow any citizen to work,
       produce and consume goods and services, and invest their wealth, as they
       please to their best abilities.

       To achieve the above-integrated development targets, Sri Lankans living
       in this country and abroad should actively contribute to the economy.
       Structural, regulatory and legal barriers to do so will be removed and
       reorganised to suit the modern world.

       In the public sector as well as in the private sector, market monopolies will
       be minimised, and efforts will be made to create a market in which labour,
       goods and capital are exchanged fairly and competitively.

       State and legal protections for individuals' physical property and intellectual
       property will be strengthened in line with international standards.

       Over the next decade, the tax burden will be gradually reduced to a
       lower single digit. Also, to protect the local entrepreneur, tariffs and other
       restrictions imposed on imports and exports will be minimised as far as
       possible and the exchange of goods and services will be facilitated.

       State regulation will be streamlined by removing obstacles for entrepreneurs
       to start new businesses and develop them rapidly.

       The freedom of workers will be further expanded by removing regulatory
       and legal barriers to deliver the maximum productivity of the country's
       labour resources.

       Domestic and foreign investments will be promoted while minimising
       regulatory and legal barriers.

       The government will refrain as much as possible from controlling the
       economic process of the state and regulation will be strengthened to
       protect the national interests, individual rights and business freedoms.

4.2 PROTECTING POLITICAL FREEDOM
   Every citizen of the republic has equal sovereignty. It cannot be given up.
   Accordingly, every citizen should have an equal right to have an opinion
   about the affairs of the republic, be able to express their opinions freely
   and be able to join a political party which represents their views. This is
   what we call political freedom.

   But as has happened from time to time in history, there are cases where some
   terrorist groups suppress other people's political freedom. For example,
   some organised groups operate repressively on social media to prevent
   holding and expressing opposing political opinions. Also, some people
   operate to destroy the political freedom of individuals by subjecting them
   to verbal threats, physical violence and torture.

   This uncivilised trend, which is not compatible with the modern world, will
   be immediately and permanently controlled and the political freedom of
   every citizen of the country will be protected.

   The freedom of speech of every citizen will be protected and the rule of
   law will be upheld so that no other citizen's freedom of speech or any other
   freedom is impeded.

   Among the various and divergent views held by the inhabitants on the
   affairs of the republic, the most successful proposition will be chosen by
   free and fair vote, after peaceful and rational debate. This is democracy.

   Efforts will be made immediately to eradicate terrorism, which tries to
   achieve its political goals by terrorising the population.

   Also, the constitution which legitimates the democratic systems and
   structures of the republic will be strengthened and all necessary steps will
   be taken to protect the political freedom of the people.

   Political education from pre-school to university will be introduced into the
   curricula.

   Political repressions seen in some educational and service institutions will
   be ended forever and the ability of every citizen to fully enjoy their political
   freedom will be guaranteed.

4.3 CARING FOR CULTURAL FREEDOM
   No matter how much economic growth is achieved, if there is no society
   with cultural values in it, it will be of no use.

   People of any nationality including Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Malay, Burgher,
   Vedi living in the Republic have equal freedom to hold and practice their
   cultural identities.


                                                                                 46
NAMAL VISION



       Also, those who hold one cultural identity will not be allowed to discriminate
       against another cultural identity as low or high, so that the ceremonies and
       practices built on the cultural roots and beliefs of the respective communities
       can be carried out peacefully without disturbing the other communities.

       Opportunities for intercultural interaction between the different cultures
       will be increased so that mutual understanding among different cultural
       communities can flourish. We believe that beautiful cultural innovations will
       be born through such human interactions.

       Linguistic and other structural barriers that may interfere with such
       interconnection will be minimised as much as possible using ICT.

       Moreover, artistic and performance opportunities will be created to
       showcase the cultural beauty of the Republic to the world.

4.4 RESPECTING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
       Every citizen of the Republic shall have equal freedom to hold, embrace,
       practice, alone or in association with others, Bauddha, Hindu, Catholic,
       Christian, Islamic or any other religion, faith or belief.

       The spiritual development of man is greatly supported by religious
       teachings. And the moral virtues to be followed for the common good
       while living in a society are taught through religions.

       But there are also cases where certain religious teachings incite their
       followers to act against the other faiths. Therefore, efforts will be made to
       ensure that religious teachings will always be in the best interest of the
       individual and society.

       Moreover, a free environment will be created where every citizen can gain
       a broad understanding of various religious beliefs and philosophies by
       providing a basic education about various religious teachings to every
       citizen as well as through peaceful and respectful conversations.

       Due to the competition required to achieve the above economic growth
       goals, psychological pressure will be created in individuals. The social
       mission of religious places such as temples, shrines and churches and their
       clergy are highly important to face such pressures and to withstand the
       world realities of good and evil, shame and praise, profit and loss, happiness
       and sorrow experienced by all human beings.

       Therefore, necessary measures will be taken to protect and improve those
       religious places.
