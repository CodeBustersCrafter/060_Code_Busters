SAJITH PREMADASA - SAMAGI JANA SANDHANAYA - A WIN FOR ALL - MANIFESTO

" My sole purpose is to lead our motherland towards prosperity while safeguarding the lives of all citizens''
Let's unite, commit, and win...!
- SAJITH PREMADASA


My fellow Sri Lankans,
As we approach a defining moment in our nation's political journey with the forthcoming Presidential election, I, Sajith Premadasa, proudly present this manifesto (Win for all), on behalf of the Samagi Jana Sandanaya (SJS) to outline our vision for a positive national transformation.
The SJS is a new political force, with a vision to create a new Sri Lanka, by introducing a social market economy with social justice at its core. We believe a true democracy is one in which every citizen's voice is heard.
Therefore, our manifesto & economic vision is not just about statistical growth but about tangible prosperity in every segment of society. We will create a resilient and inclusive economy, combining the strength of free markets with a deep commitment to equality, to ensure no Sri Lankan is left behind.
Another crucial pillar of our vision is the fight against corruption. Corruption has long been a stain on Sri Lanka and has ultimately led us to bankruptcy, undermining trust in government and robbing our citizens. The future SJS government will root out corruption by embedding transparency and accountability in every aspect of governance with the necessary system reforms.
In our pursuit of prosperity, special attention will be provided to the crucial sectors of housing, healthcare and education. We will ensure every citizen can access quality housing. The healthcare sector, which is facing myriad crises, will be reinforced with professional and technological resources to create a healthy nation. The education sector will be revamped to build internationally competitive human capital, which can thrive in a rapidly changing world while contributing to the growth of Sri Lanka.
Throughout history, nations have been developed with strong team leadership. This is why the SJS has assembled the most qualified and pragmatic, team of politicians to ensure that the ambitious goals in this manifesto are achieved.
Let me end by stating that the SJS is more than just a new alliance; it is a movement for much-needed change, driven by the belief that Sri Lanka can and must finally realize its true potential. I seek your support in this election not just for myself as your candidate but for the vision we all share for a stronger, fairer, and more prosperous nation. Let us come together to, finally, create the Sri Lanka we all deserve.

BUILD A RESILIENT ECONOMY
We prioritize equitable growth through a Social Market Economy model, ensuring that the benefits of development reach all citizens. As we chart a course toward economic recovery and lasting prosperity, we pledge transparency, sustainability and empowerment creating a future where all can thrive.

Sri Lanka is still facing its most severe economic crisis to date, caused by heavy debt, poor policy decisions, and weak governance. While recent steps have helped by lowering inflation and boosting foreign reserves, the road to full recovery and becoming an advanced economy remains extremely challenging. The average Sri Lankan has been forced to bear the brunt of the crisis, struggling with high prices and increased taxes and hopelessness.
We will follow a Social Market Economy model guided by Social Democratic Political Principles to foster equitable and inclusive growth, harnessing the power of markets while ensuring social justice and protection for all. Our Blueprint 3.0 provides a strategic plan to tackle these challenges, rebuild the economy through strong growth, and secure a prosperous future for all. A key part of this plan is erasing corruption, a necessary but not a sufficient solution. Further, promote a green economy and environmental sustainability as foundational principles for economic growth and development.
To achieve sustainable growth, we need a two-part approach: First, we must reform the economy to make it more competitive and globally connected. This will create wealth among the people. Second, we need to ensure economic justice and equity through a strong social safety net with targeted subsidies to protect the vulnerable. Additionally, we will aim to increase Gross National Happiness (GNH) by fostering a society where economic progress goes hand in hand with the well-being and overall happiness of our citizens.

TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Introducing strong anti-corruption laws and strengthening the implementation of the current legal framework will speed up justice. The recovery of stolen assets

and a robust programme to curb rampant corruption in the country's administrative system shall be key. Establishing an independent Public Prosecutor's Office free of political interference to bring to justice corrupt individuals will be done on an urgent basis by a simple amendment to legislation. We will enact a Public Procurement Law to guarantee procurement is conducted in a transparent, corruption-free and efficient manner. All government procurement shall be transferred to a digital platform.
To provide the consumer with the best quality and price, monopolistic and oligopolistic behavior will be corrected through the immediate introduction of a competition law.
We will bring in transparency in public finance management. There shall be full disclosure on expenditure plans and debt management strategies as well as in tax administration. The establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office would henceforth provide detailed analysis of all government tax and expenditure proposals.

MANAGING THE DEBT CRISIS AND THE IMF
We will strengthen fiscal discipline as per the IMF agreement and continue with difficult but necessary reforms to meet the targets of revenue, primary balance and debt. However, we will make amendments to the current programme to guarantee relief to those below poverty line and improve quality of life for Sri Lankans.
In the case of agreeing to a solution that allows for 'claw back' clauses for foreign creditors to benefit from more than expected GDP growth, we will insist that 'comparability of treatment' be extended to the EPF that bore the brunt of the domestic debt restructure.

MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICY
We will respect the autonomy of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) provided by the new Act but hold the bank fully accountable for meeting its inflation target. Furthermore, we will help ensure low and stable interest rates, an internationally competitive foreign exchange rate..

ACHIEVING A REVENUE GROWTH
The solution to increase government revenue is not confined to raising taxes. One of our first acts will be to introduce digital technology to increase revenue, minimize expenditure and corruption. We will revise the unfair burden sharing structure of the IMF supported tax code revision that is forcing professionals to seek employment abroad.
Some highlights of our revised structure that will not disturb the overall revenue targets but will reduce the heavy burden on middle- class are:
* Personal income tax: Personal income tax after the Tax-free slab of Rs 100,000 per month will start at just 1% and increase up to 24% income up to around half a million per month. Thereafter, current rates will apply for high income earners.
* Corporate income tax: We intend reducing up to 6% from the present 30% rate for profits on exports and introduce 15% Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) minimum alternate tax for multinational companies.
* VAT: We intend to reduce VAT to 15% once tax compliance improves through the use of Public Digital Infrastructure to

widening the tax net. Certain identified items in addition to essential food as consumables and inputs shall be made zero rated for VAT.
* Excise tax on cigarettes and alcohol and taxes on casinos will be adjusted to fund tax reductions.
* A guaranteed up to 15% savings interest rate will be provided for senior citizen savings.

EXPENDITURE CONTROL
Although the IMF programme has focused on increasing revenue, it has not adequately addressed government expenditure control. Therefore, our economic vision aims to control wasteful government spending and corruption. This includes reforming state enterprises. Funds so saved will be utilized to implement a social safety net for the distressed population and to strengthen education and health sectors.
We will use data-based planning to control government expenditure and strengthen transparency and accountability of government spending to increase public trust.

STIMULATING ECONOMIC GROWTH
Our government will be committed to transforming Sri Lanka into a globally connected social market economy, with private enterprise, both large and small, as the principal driver of growth. This transformation requires two key actions: enhancing global economic integration through trade liberalization and foreign direct investment and unshackling domestic markets, including product and labor markets. Ensuring effective market signals will enable full private sector engagement in national development.

 AGRICULTURAL REFORMS
We shall address challenges at multiple levels. Archaic laws need modernization. Reforms will unshackle agriculture markets, provide equitable water access through rehabilitated irrigation tanks, and offer access to finance and insurance. For the individual farmer, the entire value chain- from obtaining information on what, how much, and when to produce, to financing inputs and managing the cultivation cycle- needs improvement. Thereafter, post- harvest management in terms of storage to logistics to sale must be addressed.
We  will  implement  a  rapid, smart technology-driven agricultural modernization programme to reduce rural poverty, increase productivity, and promote sector growth. This includes interventions
- in paddy, vegetable, and plantation crops
- from planting to sale, like protected agriculture, lift irrigation, drip irrigation, and perhaps even AI-assisted hydroponic farming. This effort will become possible with the launching of the Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI).
To reduce and maintain the price of rice we will reintroduce the 'Shakthi' rice miller nation-wide cooperative programme. We will also immediately establish 'Prabhashwara', a network of climate-controlled agricultural produce warehouses around the country to reduce the 40% post-harvest loss of produce. This too will contribute to lowering the price of food.
? INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT: CONNECTING TO THE GLOBAL VALUE CHAIN
Sri Lanka will be connected to Global Manufacturing Value Chains (GMVCs) starting with manufacturing sliced components utilizing the still untapped trainable workforce and our strategic location. Here, we plan to integrate with global electronic and electrical goods production as well as

in EV components using transformation of critical material including graphite. Our government will also be committed to further advancing the success of the apparel sector.
? SERVICES: A KEY DRIVER OF VALUE CREATION
A key component of the growth plan is the service sector. We will focus on e-commerce and information technology services and in transforming Sri Lanka into a logistics service center.
? MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (MSMES) AND THE STARTUP ECO SYSTEM
MSMEs and start-ups are as important as the large corporates in driving economic growth contributing to approximately half of value addition and half of employment. MSMEs have been long neglected and currently in crisis, particularly since the pandemic and then the economic meltdown. Our government will place special emphasis in rescuing and setting a path for MSMEs to become a key contributor to the expected high growth trajectory of Sri Lanka through access to digitization, capital and programmes for training.
? PORT CITY
We will amend the law to make the Port City the Asian Regional Centre for technology services including Fintech, Biotech and Nanotech.

PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT AND DIGITALIZATION
Efficient and equitable public provision of health, education and social services is vital for economic development and civil security. Sri Lanka's public sector is responsible for providing these services. Yet although

it is massive it is plagued by overlapping roles, redundancy, and underpayment. Decades of reform have failed to address corruption and accountability issues, from public procurement to service delivery. We plan to overhaul the public service through digitalization and introducing key performance indicators to enhance productivity. This will improve management, transparency and efficiency while minimizing corruption.
Establishing a SOE Holding Company is a key part of state-owned enterprise reform. This SOE Holding Company will provide a centralised and strategic framework for managing SOE ownership, under a structure like Singapore's 'Temasek model'. What shareholding the State shall hold in each of the SOEs shall be determined based on multiple objectives of the various stakeholders, balancing national security interests with international competitiveness and efficiency.
? BUILDING A DIGITAL HEALTH PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Health sector will be transformed with high- tech solutions from drug procurement to all health services. Lessons learnt in using digital technology in '1990 Suwa Seriya' being classified one of the world's most advanced and fastest ambulance services, will be incorporated into enhancing quality and efficiency.

ENERGY AND UTILITY REFORMS
Our approach in power and energy will focus on implementing transparent, automated systems that minimize individual discretion, close loopholes for manipulation, and eliminate the incentives for 'dealmakers' to push unsolicited proposals.

While creating competition in generation and distribution is necessary, consumers and industry should not bear the burden of high energy costs due to monopoly power and inefficiency. We support cost-reflective electricity tariffs, but these costs must exclude corruption and inefficiency in power purchase agreements.
We will reassess the proposed structure in the new Act and recommend amendments to enhance the efficiency and cost- effectiveness of the reform process. Our priorities include establishing a fair electricity market, safeguarding consumer interests, improving accountability and depoliticizing the industry.
We envision not just meeting but exceeding the target of 70% renewable energy generation by 2030, aiming to make Sri Lanka a regional renewable energy powerhouse.

REFORMING THE MARKET OF FACTORS OF PRODUCTION
We shall implement factor market reforms by relaxing restrictions on land, labor, and capital markets to facilitate doing business in Sri Lanka and promote both domestic and foreign investments.
Our government is committed to implementing a national land reforms programme aimed at improving land productivity and securing land rights. A key priority will be the creation of a digital land registry, completing the ongoing "Bim Saviya" programme.
Recognizing the importance of human capital development, we will prioritize policies aimed at improving educational outcomes, developing job-relevant skills, and fostering innovation. Enhancing the quality and accessibility of education is crucial to building a competitive workforce.

Programmes will be implemented to ensure that Sri Lanka's workforce possesses the skills necessary for the jobs of tomorrow.
We will swiftly implement reforms to boost capital inflows and strengthen the domestic capital market. Key regulations will be reformed to enhance foreign direct investment (FDI) to stimulate economic growth and support existing investors.

AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT
  We will implement measures to ease the debt burden on farmers by waiving of their existing farmer loans (Govi Naya). Additionally, we will ensure farmers have access to essential credit facilities to support their farming.
  We will offer a 50kg fertilizer bag for Rs. 5,000, ensuring its continuous availability.
  We will ensure that farmers receive high, certified prices for their rice production, protecting them from exploitation and securing their livelihoods.
  We will also ensure the protection and uninterrupted provision of high-yield seeds, planting materials, pesticides, tools, and technology necessary for cultivation, all at a fair price.
  Establishing the "Farmer Intelligence Service" agricultural information market to provide farmers with the opportunity to obtain a fair price for agricultural products. Through this market, enabling the connection with domestic and foreign buyers for agricultural products and formation of forward sales contracts with them.
  Improving mobile and internet facilities in agricultural areas, enabling farmers

to receive technical advice and connect with domestic and foreign agricultural buyers using digital platforms.
  Redesigning & modernizing agricultural institutions to ensure food security.
  Improving agriculture and animal husbandry by value addition, crop diversification, introduction of modern agricultural inputs, and market expansion. Tax incentives will be provided for agricultural exports.
  Preparing "land use plans" necessary for the expansion of agricultural and commercial crops.
  Priority will be given to amending outdated laws that limit land use in a way that enhances the productivity of agricultural lands.
  Facilities will be provided to farmers to recultivate abandoned traditionally own lands and paddy fields that have been left uncultivated due to various issues.
  We will introduce an insurance scheme for farmers affected by animal incursions and cultivation or production losses.

  Providing technical support and assistance to modernize farms with new technology to increase milk, egg and meat production and ensure supply without scarcity. The production of essential food items will be encouraged through guaranteed prices.
  Providing tax incentives and encouragement for introducing modern  methods  such  as drip

irrigation, protected indoor cultivation, greenhouses, drone technology, and AI technology to agriculture.
  Developing a methodology to encourage small and medium-scale entrepreneurs of agriculture with access to affordable credit.
  Continuously providing necessary state patronage to promote tea, rubber, coconut, sugarcane, cinnamon, and other export agricultural crops.

  19 We acknowledge the challenges faced by tea smallholders in Sri Lanka and are dedicated to implementing targeted policies that address their current issues, enhance their productivity, and ensure their long-term prosperity.
  Steps will be taken to expand the international export market for spices including cinnamon and pepper, and measures taken to provide the necessary technology to introduce value-added products, and to ensure product standards and quality. Cultivations will be expanded, and modern technology introduced for research, technology, and management.

LAND, IRRIGATION AND WATER MANAGEMENT
  The government will establish a comprehensive National Land Bank to optimize land utilization and streamline market operations. Recognizing that land is a crucial factor in economic development and market dynamics, this

initiative will centralize land information, facilitate efficient allocation, and support sustainable development.
  Steps will be taken to provide freehold deeds within 5 years to land permit holders occupying government lands.
  The legal system necessary for protecting water sources and catchment areas will be strengthened.
  The government will make necessary investments to maintain the capacity of inland reservoirs at the maximum level. To ensure that all minor, medium, and major irrigation schemes will be rehabilitated and maintain to achieve required water demand..

TRANSPORTATION - ROAD, SEA AND AIR
  Building a multi-faceted public transport system with eco-friendly, modern buses, electrification of railways, light rail system, and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) empowered by smart technology.
  Speedy completion of the work on the Central Expressway will be ensured.

  Prioritizing the provision of necessary investments to improve fishing harbors and anchorages.

TOURISM

  Implementing	the	detailed recommendations outlined in the "Tourism Policy for Sri Lanka: A Blueprint for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth" policy prepared by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, and taking steps to make Sri Lanka's tourism sector the country's foremost foreign exchange earning avenue will be considered a prime responsibility of the government.
  The corrupt "VFS visa agreement" signed by the current government will be annulled, and a new modern system will be established to allow foreign tourists to obtain visas easily at a lower cost. Additionally, steps will be taken to ensure accountability for this transaction, which is considered the largest corruption case in Sri Lanka.

Considering this, we plan to introduce initiatives such as insurance and childcare facilities to ensure a sustainable environment for all stakeholders.

MSME (MICRO, SMALL, AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES) SECTOR
  The SJB was the first political party to recognize the critical situation facing the MSME sector. We have consistently voiced concerns about the sector's conditions both in and outside of parliament. Furthermore, we facilitated meetings between MSME sector representatives and key international financial institutions, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank (WB), European Union (EU), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to explore potential support and solutions.
  In response to pressure from the SJB, the government suspended the enforcement of the Parate Law until December 15, 2024, providing relief to the MSME sector. Under future governance, we commit to granting a reasonable extension to this suspension. Additionally, we will mandate all state and commercial banks to establish dedicated MSME loan departments.

      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
      Sri Lanka is still facing its most severe economic crisis to date, caused by heavy debt,
      poor policy decisions, and weak governance. While recent steps have helped by lowering
      inflation and boosting foreign reserves, the road to full recovery and becoming an
      advanced economy remains extremely challenging. The average Sri Lankan has been
      forced to bear the brunt of the crisis, struggling with high prices, and increased taxes and
      hopelessness.

      Our Blueprint 3.0 provides a strategic plan to tackle these challenges, rebuild the
      economy through inclusive growth, and secure a prosperous future for all upon the
      principles of our social market economy model within our broad political ideology of a
      social democracy.

      A key part of this plan is erasing corruption, a necessary but not a sufficient solution.

      To achieve sustainable growth, we need a two-part approach: First, we must reform the
      economy to make it more competitive and globally connected. This will create wealth
      among the people. Second, we need to ensure economic justice and equity through a
      strong social safety net with targeted subsidies to protect the vulnerable.

      Underlying all reforms and social protection linking government with citizens shall be a
      comprehensive digital platform.

      The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) is committed to providing the leadership needed to

ECONOMIC BREAKDOWN AND
THE ROAD TO RECOVERY
In the 76 years since our independence, Sri Lanka has made significant progress in human
development, despite ongoing human rights issues and gaps in democratic governance.
However, our economic performance has been uneven, with a severe crisis from 2021-2022
marking a low point in our history.

 OUR APPROACH:

BUILDING A JUST AND PROSPEROUS
SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY
Within our political ideology of a social democracy, our economic model of a Social Market
Economy fosters equitable and inclusive growth by harnessing the power of markets while
ensuring economic justice and social protection for all.

Economic freedom fuels innovation and growth. That is why we advocate market-oriented policy
reforms to promote competition and openness to international trade and investment. We believe
that this freedom goes hand in hand with fiscal responsibility, a stable currency, price stability, and
a flexible labour market.

The government must ensure a fair distribution of these benefits without compromising
individual economic initiatives. Economic justice requires targeted policies that safeguard the
vulnerable and ensure equitable distribution of resources. This includes efficient social safety nets
that directly assist those in need, rather than solely relying on broad subsidies.

Achieving these goals requires combining economic reforms with a robust institutional
framework. This includes transparent governance and independent regulatory bodies, particularly
a central bank free from political influence. We envision a strong foundation of rule of law that
protects property rights and contracts. Crucially, we advocate for an efficient State that focuses
on its core functions effectively – a State that acts impartially, guided by clear rules rather than
arbitrary discretionary power.


The Growth Challenge
Understanding Sri Lanka’s long-term development trajectory and current economic challenges is
crucial for effective growth diagnostics. After gaining independence, Sri Lanka initially benefited
from the Korean War’s impact on rubber, which provided a temporary economic boost. However,
from the mid-1950s to 1977, centralization and inward-looking policies stifled export growth.
Although liberalization in 1977 spurred initial investment and trade, the growth remained largely
driven by imports. Efforts to address economic imbalances were undermined by the incomplete
reform agenda, financial mismanagement, and civil conflict.

Despite these challenges, Sri Lanka achieved an average annual real GDP per capita growth
of 4.2% from 1990 to 2009. Growth peaked above 7% from 2010 to 2012, driven by debt-fueled
infrastructure projects, but then stabilized around 4%. The end of the conflict and global recession
recovery initially boosted investor confidence, leading to such growth. However, growth slowed
to 2.6% in early 2019 due to domestic issues, including the Easter Sunday attacks. The Covid-19
pandemic caused a record 4.6% contraction in the economy in 2020. Following the debt crisis, the
economy contracted by 7.3% in 2022 and again by 2.3% in 2023.

As we move forward, our immediate goal is to recover from the contraction since 2019 and aim
at achieving a full recovery from the crisis and placing the economy on a journey towards an
advanced economy. If Sri Lanka can register an annual growth rate of 10% consecutively from 2029
(given the IMF and government agreed growth rate increasing only up to 3.1% by then), we could
achieve high-income status by reaching an annual GNI per capita of approximately USD 23,000 by
2047.

Our growth strategy focuses on two main areas:

     01         TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

 Sri Lanka ranked 115th out of 180 countries in the 2023 Corruption Perceptions Index, scoring 34
 out of 100. Addressing corruption is critical for fiscal consolidation, inclusive growth, and social
 development. The 2023 IMF Diagnostic Assessment revealed widespread corruption across
 government, especially in revenue collection and public procurement. We agree with these
 findings. These weaknesses are magnified because accountability institutions lack the will and
 competence to address these issues. To combat this cancer of corruption, our government
 will implement all sixteen priority recommendations that will prioritize transparency, leverage
 technology, and introduce stronger laws. In fact, we will go further and create an independent
 public prosecutor to remove all possibilities for political interference to bring to justice those who
 have robbed. Enhancing transparency requires fixing structural issues and gaps in legal and
 regulatory frameworks.


 1.1 THE RIGHT LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO ERADICATE CORRUPTION:
 STRENGTHENING CIABOC
 Sri Lanka’s Anti-Corruption Act, No. 9 of 2023, establishes an autonomous commission to
 investigate bribery, corruption, and related offenses. This commission can collaborate with both
 domestic and foreign agencies, enhancing its effectiveness. While the Commission to Investigate
 Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) has operated for over two decades, the new Act
 gives it significant new duties. These include developing anti-corruption strategies, preventing,
 investigating, and prosecuting corruption, and coordinating anti-corruption efforts across the
 government. To further promote transparency and fight corruption, we will implement additional
 legal measures.



   Intervention                                                                         Time frame

   Stronger CIABOC: Grant CIABOC the authority for independent
   investigations, collaborate with local and international counterparts for joint            S
   probes, conduct search and seizure operations, make warrantless arrests, and
   take other necessary actions against corruption.

   Asset declaration: Implement legislation requiring that elected
   representatives and public officials declare assets and liability.                         S
   Note: This is currently being implemented.

   Unexplained Wealth Law: Create an Unexplained Wealth Law under which
   any citizen can report an individual suspected of acquiring wealth through                 S
   dubious means according to the criteria specified in the Act to the public
   prosecutor’s office.


 1.2 AN INDEPENDENT PUBLIC PROSECUTOR’S OFFICE
 Sri Lanka’s Attorney General’s (AG) Office has a conflict of interest in corruption litigation. On
 the one hand, the AG appears on behalf of the Government and its officials. On the other hand,
 the AG will be called in to prosecute the same officials if they are being charged for corruption.
 The current practice is that the AG’s Office is frequently involved in such matters without any
 guidelines to safeguard independence and transparency. The AG also has sole discretion to
 discontinue criminal proceedings before a High Court in respect of a suspect.

  Public Prosecutor’s Office: Establish an Independent Office of the Public
  Prosecutor for Bribery or Corruption that is free from the influence of                  S
  the AG; both factual and perceived. This requires only a simple legislative
  amendment, not a Constitutional amendment.

  Expedite corruption cases: Refile all corruption charges withdrawn by the                S
  AG due to technical reasons and expedite cases that have been dragging.




1.3 MECHANISM FOR PUBLIC PROCUREMENT
Sri Lanka’s expenditure on public procurement is very large. Therefore, even minor irregularities
could lead to significant corruption. Lack of procurement planning, ignoring procurement
procedures, inadequate competition and accepting unsolicited proposals for large infrastructure
projects are a few of the major flaws in the system. Various ad-hoc changes have been made to
procurement guidelines and a high degree of executive discretion in present in decision making.
All these issues and more have led to massive corruption in procurement. We will address these
flaws by enacting new laws and strengthening the institutional framework and transparency in
public procurement.



  Intervention                                                                        Time frame

  Public Procurement Law: Enact legislation that reflect global best practices
  and ensure all public procurement is mandatorily covered by this new                     S
  legislation. Establish the necessary institutional structure to implement the
  law.

  E-procurement: Move all public procurement transactions to an
  e-Government Procurement Platform and publish all procurement with                       M
  relevant details for public scrutiny.



1.4 NEW LAWS FOR ASSET RECOVERY
The current asset recovery laws have gaps that hinder efforts to tackle complex transnational
financial crimes. The proposed Stolen Asset Recovery Act will address these issues, providing a
strong legal framework to fight corruption and recover assets stolen by politicians and officials.
We will include the following initiatives in the new law.

   International frameworks:
    Implement the G20 Nine Key Principles of Effective Asset Recovery to
     guide legislative efforts. This includes making asset recovery a policy               S
     priority, aligning resources to support policy, and empowering authorities
     to trace, seize, and confiscate stolen assets promptly.

    Ratify the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC)
     to enhance the legal framework for asset recovery and strengthen                      M
     international cooperation.

   Legal cases: Integrate asset recovery mechanisms into corruption case                   S
   settlements.


 1.5 TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN PUBLIC FINANCIAL
 MANAGEMENT (PFM)
 Fiscal transparency is crucial on two levels. First, the government should provide clear information
 on budget promises and obligations, including spending plans, program allocations, and debt
 management strategies. Second, tax administration must be transparent. As described in the IMF
 2023 Diagnostic Assessment, corruption among revenue officers, including top management, is
 widespread. We propose new structures, systems, and technology to change this.



   Intervention                                                                       Time frame

   Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO): Fast-track the establishment of an
   independent PBO which will assess costs and benefits of each budget
   or cabinet approved expenditure proposal including every infrastructure                 S
   project above a certain threshold and make its findings public. Encourage
   independent think tanks to work with the PBO to evaluate PFM measures.

   Public accountability: Mandate publication of regular reviews assessing the
   effectiveness of all tax incentives and consider amendments as necessary.
   Mandate that all proposed tax incentives be evaluated, discussed and                    S
   approved by the Committee on Public Finance prior to being debated by
   Parliament.

   Local government budgets: Bring local government bodies and provincial
   councils within the scope of the Public Financial Management (PFM) Act and              M
   mandate submission of quarterly reports on revenue and expenditure.

 The foundation for all these initiatives will be a ‘Digital Public Infrastructure’ (DPI) platform,
 which will promote transparency, accountability, and efficiency across the economy. More
 information on the features of this keystone project is in Section 7 (Public Sector Management and
 Digitalisation).

   02             DEBT CRISIS MANAGEMENT

Sri Lanka’s sovereign debt crisis remains a serious economic challenge. While there has been
progress in debt restructuring negotiations, achieving debt sustainability is still a long road ahead.
Many Sri Lankans fear another crisis due to delays and the potential for a ‘bad deal’. The key
solution is swift but fair negotiations leading to a final agreement.


2.1 CONTINUE DEBT RESTRUCTURING NEGOTIATIONS
The government has finalized bilateral debt agreements with the Official Creditor Committee
(OCC), which includes Paris Club nations, India, and China (Exim Bank). Agreements with the Ad-
Hoc group representing international sovereign bond (ISB) holders, and the China Development
Bank are being assessed for comparability with the OCC and IMF’s debt sustainability parameters.2
The restructuring must be completed swiftly. We also advocate for equitable treatment of all
creditors. If ISB holders benefit from better-than-expected economic performance as proposed
by the Ad-Hoc group of ISB holders, we believe the EPF should also share in this upside via a
‘claw back’ condition included via an amendment to the debt restructure agreement between
the government and the EPF.3 Under an SJB government, we will rebuild trust and credibility
among creditors and international financial markets by combining key economic aspects of
debt restructuring with improved governance. We will actively manage our liabilities through a
dedicated and competent treasury management entity under the active liability management
legislation (2018).



  Intervention                                                                                           Time frame

  Debt negotiations: If the external debt restructuring remains incomplete by
  the time of the election, we will immediately provide the political leadership                                S
  required to negotiate the best possible deal for Sri Lanka with both the
  bilateral and commercial creditors.

  Debt management: Create a public debt office and staff it with highly
  skilled, well-paid professionals who can manage Sri Lanka’s debt dynamically
  in order to benefit from market movements. Note: Parliament passed the
  Public Debt Management Bill but has not yet established the public debt                                       M
  office. In 2018 Parliament enacted the Active Liability Management Act which
  provides the legal basis for a robust management of the nation’s outstanding
  debt.




2The SJB strongly opposed the Ad-Hoc group’s April 2024 proposal, arguing that the nominal 28% haircut under the
GDP-linked bond (Macro Linked Bond) structure would effectively be only 7.3% by 2028 when the haircut would actually
take place based on independent projections of GDP (in USD) by then. Our criticism, echoed by think tanks and other
opposition parties, sent a clear message that the deal was unacceptable. This pressure helped the government negotiate
an effective MLB of 14.96% in July 2024. The SJB has also sought clarification on a ‘claw back clause’ in the OCC agreement
to ensure fair treatment between OCC and commercial creditors regarding the haircut and net present value of the new
ISB series.While the deal is not perfect, it is a significant step toward economic recovery. We are pleased with our role in
strengthening the government’s negotiating position and securing a better outcome for Sri Lanka.

3We have informed the IMF of our stance.

 2.2 ENGAGE WITH IMF TO AMEND CERTAIN TERMS OF THE EFF
 An SJB government aims to amend the current EFF agreement to ensure “reform with relief”
 while staying within the agreed, and periodically updated, Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
 parameters. We were the first (in 2020) to argue that an IMF program was essential to prevent a
 deep economic crisis in Sri Lanka and to restore stability and credibility in international financial
 markets. This EFF focuses on fiscal consolidation and better economic governance but does not
 sufficiently address the structural flaws that made the economy vulnerable to the sovereign debt
 crisis. From 2009 to 2014 in particular GDP growth was driven mainly by non-tradable sectors like
 construction, utilities, and services, primarily driven by public infrastructure projects. Over 70% of
 the increase in GDP during this period came from non-tradable production, reducing the share of
 tradable in GDP from over 30% to about 20% by 2020.

 Restoring macroeconomic stability is important to emerge from the crisis with debt sustainability;
 but addressing the non-tradable bias in the economy is crucial for sustainable growth beyond
 stabilization. The IMF estimates that Sri Lanka will have over $62 billion in foreign debt by 2027.
 To manage this debt, we must generate surpluses in both the primary fiscal account and the
 current account balance. The SJB development strategy prioritizes “building bridges to the world”
 by fostering an export-oriented economy. We will incentivize tradable production (both export-
 oriented production and internationally competitive import-substitution production) over non-
 tradable sectors by addressing the anti-tradable bias through monetary, exchange rate, trade, and
 competition reforms. More information on this is in Section 6 (Incentivise Growth). Accordingly, we
 propose amending the IMF EFF agreement to address the incentive structure, within the broad
 contours of the program4. This will help build an outward-oriented, dynamic economy capable of
 sustained and equitable growth.

 While ensuring adequate government revenue and controlling expenditure, it is also important
 to review the tax structure to minimise the negative impact on the middle class, and to maintain
 a well-targeted social safety net to protect the poor. This shall be the amendments for ‘relief’. See
 Section 4 (Revenue Consolidation) and Section 10 (Stronger Social Safety Nets) for details.


   Intervention                                                                                            Time frame

   EFF amendments: Agree with the IMF to amend the EFF agreement to meet
   the below objectives, while maintaining the agreed revenue-based fiscal
   consolidation targets and meeting the structural benchmarks within the
   agreed, and periodically updated, DSA parameters:
    Revised incentive structures to rejuvenate tradable production by removing
     the non-tradable bias in the economy. This would involve revising the
     corporate income tax regime for the tradable sector upon a thorough
     assessment.
                                                                                                                 S
    Revised slabs and rates for personal income taxes to ensure greater equity
     and fairness, particularly for the middle class. The loss of revenue shall be
     recovered by adjusting withholding taxes, excise taxes and taxes on gross
     gaming revenue on casinos and other such industries. Described in Section
     4 (Revenue Consolidation)

    Revised social safety net criteria and recipient selection to ensure a better
     focused cash transfer program to protect the vulnerable groups as the
     current Aswesuma scheme is inappropriate.


 4We have explained the need for this amendment in the program to the IMF. This will, in particular, involve reconsidering
 the incentive structure for the tradable sector.

2.3 ENSURE FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY WHILE DEALING WITH
THE NPL ISSUES
Sri Lanka’s financial system stability has improved with reforms under the IMF EFF program.
Domestic debt restructuring excluded banks due to purported asset quality issues,5 and
funds were allocated for recapitalizing state banks. The new Central Bank Act and better bank
regulations have also improved financial system governance. However, vulnerabilities remain,
with non-performing loans (NPLs) rising to 13.6% by Q3 2023 from 5.2% in 2019.6 The government
suspended the Parate law until December 15, 2024, to provide relief to micro, small and medium
scale enterprises (MSMEs), preventing banks from auctioning collateral properties. About
60% of MSMEs have faced severe challenges.7 However, there is no clear plan for MSMEs after
the suspension ends. A further suspension needs re-evaluation to balance loan recovery and
enterprise support. A clear roadmap is essential to protect depositors, and it is crucial to offer
fair negotiation opportunities between creditors and debtors. Understanding the sectors most
impacted by the Parate law will help tailor support measures and foster a resilient economy.

Sri Lanka must also create a more efficient and predictable system for dealing with corporate and
individual insolvency. A well-designed bankruptcy system allows companies to adapt and recover
from setbacks, fostering business stability and growth. An efficient insolvency process allows
entrepreneurs to take calculated risks and creates a safety net that encourages innovation and
experimentation, which are essential for economic growth.

  Loan revival units: Mandate all banks to have a loan revival unit where
  advice will be given to restructure non-performing loans, such as by fully
  implementing the CBSL’s March 2024 directive for licensed banks to                                            S
  reformulate Post Covid-19 Revival Units into Business Revival Units (BRUs) to
  support viable businesses and manage increased impaired assets.

  Insolvency regime:
   Prioritise establishment of a streamlined insolvency law specifically
                                                                                                                S
    designed for MSMEs.

   Introduce a comprehensive Chapter 11 style bankruptcy law8 which will                                      M
    provide a more flexible and efficient process for restructuring or resolving
    financial distress for larger businesses.

    03          MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICY

 Monetary policy must balance credible inflation control with economic stabilization. These efforts
 should be complemented by initiatives to restore price stability and rebuild foreign reserves,
 potentially through increased exchange rate flexibility.


 3.1 STRENGTHEN THE INDEPENDENCE AND TRANSPARENCY OF
 THE CENTRAL BANK AND INTEREST RATES
 A key milestone of the IMF program was the enactment of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL)
 Act, No. 16 of 2023. This legislation boosts CBSL’s independence and accountability, ensuring price
 stability through a new inflation targeting regime. The Act requires the Minister and Governor to
 set and publish inflation targets, while CBSL must release biannual reports on inflation trends,
 sources, projections, and risks. This independent mandate is crucial for economic stability and
 growth. Respecting CBSL’s autonomy under this new law is vital for sustained macroeconomic
 stability in Sri Lanka.

 From June 2023, CBSL adopted a more accommodative monetary policy, reducing policy interest
 rates by 700 basis points by July 2024. Lending rates are now at 9.25% and deposit rates at 8.25%.
 This, along with lower risk premiums on government securities, has reduced market lending rates.
 However, interest rates for MSMEs remain high due to perceived lending risks.

 While recognizing the autonomy of the CBSL on interest rate policy, we expect the CBSL to
 support the general economic policy framework of the Government as provided for in the new
 legislation through the consultative process via the Coordination Council.



   Intervention                                                                      Time frame

   CBSL independence: Ensure CBSL's independence to stop discretionary
   money printing, combining its institutional independence with accountability           M
   to Parliament. Note: This was achieved by passing the Central Bank Act, No.
   16 of 2023. We will resist political pressure to rescind this Act.

   Manage inflation: Allow CBSL to adjust policy rates to balance controlling
   inflation and keeping credit costs manageable for investors and firms. This is
   a complex matter, and we believe that it is crucial that the CBSL is brought
   on board regarding the need for a tradable-biased economic model and                    S
   international competitiveness, given the periodic inflation targets to be
   agreed with the government. There has to be strict fiscal and monetary
   discipline to ensure success.

   Rates: Move towards obtaining weekly bill and bond funding requirements
   from the market at market-clearing rates. Note: Currently, much of the                  S
   weekly requirement is met by the market, with CBSL still funding part of it.

3.2 EXCHANGE RATE POLICY
The strategy for exchange rate management includes identifying the market-determined level
through a transitional floating phase and then stabilizing it through CBSL interventions to
correct erratic deviations. This should be accompanied by lifting the foreign exchange restrictions
imposed on current account transactions and removing quantitative import restrictions during
the crisis, building adequate reserves, and regaining access to capital markets. The CBSL should
avoid the temptation to intervene against market forces to manage the nominal exchange rate
to control inflation (to maintain inflation targets) or to reduce external debt servicing costs. It is
important to permit determination of the nominal exchange rate by market forces so that the
real exchange rate (nominal exchange rate adjusted for our relative price differences with trading
partners) plays its expected role of maintaining our international competitiveness.

We shall maintain controls over most speculative short-term capital inflows while lifting
restrictions on foreign exchange transactions and foreign direct investment during the reform
period. Short-term capital inflows can put unnecessary pressure on macroeconomic management
during economic recovery.

  Exchange equilibrium: Allow the exchange rate to reach its market
  equilibrium through transitional phasing, adjusting with domestic inflation
  to maintain international competitiveness. Note: CBSL has achieved some                   S
  stability, though import restrictions remain. Currently, the exchange rate is
  appreciating.

    04              REVENUE CONSOLIDATION

 Government revenue has historically been low in Sri Lanka. The highest average ratio of revenue-
 to-GDP was recorded between 1989 and 1991, amounting to 23.3%. However, the decline that
 started in 2004 continued until 2014 with revenue falling to 11.2% in 2014 and then again rising to
 12% in 2019 with the new Inland Revenue Act of 2018. This trend was reversed after major tax cuts
 in 2019, dropping to 8.4% of GDP in 2021. In contrast, the average government revenue-to-GDP
 in emerging and middle-income countries similar to Sri Lanka for 2019-2022 is 26%. It is clear we
 are an outlier. Government revenue must increase, and the current target of 15.4% by 2027-2029
 is acceptable. Without such revenue it is impossible for the government to spend on critical
 infrastructure, be it economic, such as rail or road, or be it social, such as health or education.

 However, a 2024 UNDP study shows that a majority of Sri Lankans are not at all happy with the
 current tax regime, albeit not being aware of the general concepts of taxation.9 The study found
 most people were not registered for tax (did not have a TIN number) and were not eager to do so
 either (According to the IRD, only 743,000 people were registered for tax at end 2023; an increase
 from 246,000 in 2022 but still much less than the 1,431,000 registered in 2019). Most only paid
 indirect taxes. Yet, they were not satisfied with the services they received for their taxes. The vast
 majority believed that the current tax regime was unreasonable, and the government should cut
 expenditure to deal with the debt issue instead of raising taxes.

 Sri Lanka’s tax revenue mainly comes from three sources: The Inland Revenue Department
 (IRD), Sri Lanka Customs (SLC), and the Excise Department of Sri Lanka (EDSL). The IRD handles
 income and corporate taxes, SLC manages import taxes and duties, and EDSL deals with licenses
 for alcohol, tobacco and other such excise goods. However, these institutions always fail to meet
 their revenue targets. Ad-hoc policy changes, lack of administrative capacity and inefficiency, and
 technological constraints are key issues. Corruption in all three agencies was also called out in the
 IMF’s 2023 Governance Diagnostic Assessment.10

 The IRD has tried to improve this situation with the Revenue Administration Management
 Information System (RAMIS) since 2014, but its implementation has been slow and problematic
 – particularly in integrating RAMIS to key government departments. As of December 31, 2023, the
 IRD had over Rs. 1,000 billion in unpaid taxes. There are approximately 350 ongoing legal cases
 related to default taxes, and almost 5,000 appeals at the IRD and Tax Appeals Commission.11

 Besides the above, numerous exemptions for certain sectors, and individual projects, have further
 complicated tax collection. Discretion enjoyed by politicians to hand out tax holidays for projects
 for as long as 25 years.



 9UNDP and the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, 2024.

 10A major corruption issue was the “sugar scam.” The government lost significant revenue when the Special Commodity
 Levy on sugar imports was suddenly reduced from Rs. 50/kg to Cents 25/kg in October 2020. The Auditor General reported
 that this led to a revenue forgone of over Rs. 16 billion. The conclusion was that the reduction mainly benefited a few
 importers (who seemed to have prior knowledge of this change) while consumers did not benefit. The most recent
 calculation of the revenue foregone until the SCL was brought back to Rs. 50/kg in November 2023 is Rs. 80 billion. This is
 just one example among many such cases.

introduced by 2008 the Strategic Development Project Act and more recently by the Port City
Commission Act (less discretionary, yet long term tax relief) continue to a be significant drain on
revenue. The government has simply increased all taxes (personal, corporate and VAT), introduced
new ones (turnover tax, i.e. social security contribution levy) and reduced taxable thresholds for in
2023, without addressing these fundamental issues of revenue leakages.

With respect to direct taxes, a broader tax base is needed to avoid overburdening the working
middle class, who cannot escape Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) taxes. As for indirect taxes, the current
tax regime does not exclude even basic consumption and investment necessities. Only by
implementing comprehensive tax reforms and innovative financial and technological strategies
can we reach long-term fiscal stability and economic growth. This will allow for a fairer tax system
and alleviate unfair pressure on individual taxpayers while fostering a more robust economy.


         Challenges and Discrepancies in Personal Income Tax Collection
         A Closer Look at 2023 and 2024
         In 2023, the sharp rise in personal income tax through PAYE amid high inflation heavily
         burdened many professionals, worsening the brain drain. Initially, PAYE revenue was projected
         at Rs. 68 billion, but later revised to Rs. 100 billion. However, the IRD collected Rs. 144 billion.
         For 2024 the estimate is Rs. 160 billion, but collection is projected to be Rs. 200 billion. This
         discrepancy indicates that the original estimate could have been met with lower rates or wider
         tax slabs, but the government decided to maximize collection as there was no escape from
         PAYE for employees. In contrast, the IRD expected Rs. 115 billion from non-PAYE component
         of Personal Income Tax (PIT) but only collected Rs. 48 billion. The estimate for 2024 is Rs. 80
         billion, but projection is only Rs. 40 billion. This gap highlights low voluntary compliance. These
         outcomes suggest that revenue targets could certainly be met by even with lower PIT rates but
         improved compliance.


We will create a broad tax consultation mechanism with the formal and informal private sector
and professionals to gather their input before finalizing our tax policy reforms within the
overarching IMF EFF framework. Our key interventions are:

 Intervention                                                                                    Timeframe
 Administrative reforms
 Unified revenue authority: Establish a Revenue Authority incorporating the IRD                         M
 and subsequently Customs and Excise departments. In the medium term, such an
 entity will enhance professionalism and efficiency of revenue collection, and in due
 course it would become a separate government service with salary levels on par
 with the CBSL.
 Modernization and digitalization: In the meantime, modernize the three                                 S
 departments, improve and strengthen the rewards and accountability schemes,
 and ensure existing technology platforms (i.e., RAMIS at IRD and ASYCUDA at
 Customs) are fully operational, while introducing a platform to Excise.
 Registration of high-income earners: Undertake a nationwide campaign among                         S       M
 all professional bodies to articulate the importance of paying taxes, and a logistics
 operation to register and provide a TIN. This would have two components: firstly,
 to open tax files for all persons with WHT obligations and public sector employees
 beyond the tax-free threshold; and secondly, to mandate that members of
 professional bodies open tax files with the IRD.

  Intervention                                                                                           Timeframe
  Ombudsman: Via legislation, establish an Ombudsman, i.e., an independent ruling                           S       M
  authority to deal with the issue of tax appeals and long litigation. This Office will
  have binding authority over the Tax Appeals Commission and the IRD and inspire
  public trust and confidence and become an alternative to costly and lengthy legal
  battles.
  Public asset management: Create a taskforce to assess government assets                                       S
  and identify opportunities to increase non-tax revenue. Increase revenue on
  government owned assets, fees, and returns from government organisations.
  Ensure service quality is improved at the same time. Where agency-specific funds
  exist, flow through to Consolidated Fund.
  Draft Tax Reforms
  As mentioned, we are fully cognizant of the need to stay within the EFF agreement                             S
  with the IMF on revenue consolidation. Within this framework we propose to
  make the tax structure more equitable and remove the anti-tradable bias in the
  economy. We will establish a special unit incorporating all relevant stakeholders
  to serve as a secretariat to transparently arrive at a consensus on the best possible
  structure.
   Middle class tax cut: Our proposed ‘middle class personal income tax
    adjustment’ is to amend the marginal rates from 1% to 24% going up to a
    monthly income of approximately half a million rupees while keeping the
    current tax-free threshold as is. Thereafter the current marginal tax rates shall
    remain. We also intend to maintain the current slabs almost the same.12

   Our objective here is to ensure that the bulk of the mid-level executives;
    managers, professionals and academics who were subjected to severe
    difficulties in maintaining their living standards during the adjustment period
    are once again able to get back to some level of normalcy. The challenge,
    however, is to ensure compliance among taxpayers outside and beyond PAYE
    so that the unfair burden on the PAYE only taxpayers is removed. Our belief is
    that with affordable rates, ease of paying taxes by digitization and with increased
    citizen responsibility along with a stronger social contract we will be able to
    meet the targets agreed with the IMF.

   Amendments to Corporate Income Tax (CIT): The theme throughout our
    blueprint is to ensure strong, sustainable and equitable growth driven by the
    tradable sector in goods and services. The amendments shall be to enable
    such a reality while keeping to the overall targets. Given that we are not privy to
    internal disaggregated data for all line items by sector, it is prudent to await a
    comprehensive analysis before we announce a proposal on CIT (and other para
    tariffs), suffice it to say our objective is to remove the non-tradable bias in the
    economy. A significant downward adjustment for exporters perhaps upto 6%,
    shall be announced without disturbing total CIT.


   We have used latest available tax data and made certain assumptions. Upon taking office we will be able to confirm
  12

  the assumptions and make modifications as required keeping the objectives in place.

                                                                            SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY



 Intervention                                                                                Timeframe
  Amendments to VAT: We plan to lower the VAT rate to 15% except for a selected                S
   list which shall stay at 18% as soon as soon as we are able to improve compliance
   through the proposed digitalization of tax collection and information sharing
   via the DPI. We shall either zero rate or apply a low rate of VAT on identified
   essential items included recently and on imported food, which is currently
   liable for Special Commodity Levy (SCL) to be removed as per IMF agreement.
   This list shall include items such as high protein food for infants, medical
   and educational equipment and input for animal feed (to lower the cost of
   production of high protein food), besides the SCL liable list.
  Amendments to SVAT: The original SVAT (Suspended VAT) was only applicable                    S
   for genuine exporters but subsequently a revised SVAT (simplified VAT) was
   introduced to include several other categories. The government has announced
   the removal of SVAT by 1 January 2025. We are not convinced this is a positive
   move. Instead, we believe reverting to the original SVAT (Suspended VAT) for
   exporters and manufacturers supplying locally produced goods for exporters is
   a better solution. We shall discuss the pros and cons widely before arriving at a
   final decision.
  Amendments to Withholding Tax (WHT): To balance the losses in revenue to                     S
   provide relief to the middle class WHT on interest shall be increased from the
   current level. A WHT-free threshold for deposits held by those above the age of
   65 years shall be announced. While WHT is not an additional tax but only a tax
   collection mechanism and theoretically would only have a cash flow impact, it
   will be effective in bringing to the tax net those who are voluntarily supposed to
   pay but evade, improved compliance. To implement this scheme, the IRD refund
   mechanism must be perfected. Any delays in refunds on the part of the IRD
   beyond, for example 7 days, would be made liable to an interest to be paid to the
   taxpayer.
  Amendments to Excise Tax: Excise is a per unit tax, as opposed to an ad valorem              S
   or percentage tax. Thus, unless the tax level is periodically adjusted to equally
   reflect the increase in the selected price level, the tax per unit would fall. This
   has been the case over the years. In 2023, the government undertook with the
   IMF to automatically index excise tax for alcohol and tobacco at the beginning
   of 2024, but this has not happened. We plan to implement this, upon a
   comprehensive study of the market. There is a massive ongoing racket involving
   the collection of excise tax on alcohol, as the security (tax) sticker on the bottle is
   being counterfeited. Beyond taking action to collect lost revenue we propose to
   implement a two-signature tax sticker on alcohol bottles wherein counterfeiting
   will no longer be possible.
  Excise tax on motor vehicles (including electric vehicles) shall be reviewed in
   order to ensure both the nation moves towards EVs and revenue to the State is
   improved. The restrictions on import of vehicles shall be removed.




                                                                                                    P | 21

  Intervention                                                                           Timeframe
   Amendments to tax applicable to casinos: Currently casinos are taxed at                     S
    15% on its Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) and 40% on profit based on their
    assessment. There are licence fees and other fees, but neither VAT nor SSCL is
    applicable. Also, given its nature of business is in cash no proper audits have
    been conducted. We believe it is better to have a simple consolidated tax on
    GGR that is comparable to most other jurisdictions. We shall establish a Gaming
    (Casino) Regulator as a matter of priority for the benefit of all stakeholders and
    for ensuring the correct amount of taxes are collected.
   Replace the imputed rental income tax with a fair property tax: We opposed                  M
    the proposed imputed rental income tax, as it would have been detrimental
    to the average homeowner whose only house would also have been subjected
    to an unfair tax. Thus, we shall not impose the imputed rental income tax. A
    property tax levied on the property (not the house) would be more equitable.
    We plan to hold thorough discussions with all stakeholders on using technology
    (drone maps etc.) to determine the values of properties in identified blocks.
   Reintroduce the tax on sweetened beverages to the same level of 2017: This                  S
    tax has been changed frequently. Beyond revenue, this will impact the fight
    against non-communicable diseases such as overweight and diabetes. We plan
    to have a public consultation on the WHO recommended tax rates to arrive at a
    suitable solution.
   Adopt global best practices: Become signatory to Base Erosion and Profit                    M
    Shifting (BEPS) Digital Economy frameworks. Introduce 15% global minimum
    alternative tax for multinational companies (OECD BEPS Pillar 2).
   Consumption shall be the jurisdiction for taxes on services: Services produced              M
    and consumed locally are subjected to VAT while the same service produced
    overseas but consumed locally is not. A classic example is PickMe vs Uber. We
    will amend the legislation to bring both parties to the same tax treatment.
  Import duties:                                                                            M       L
   Revise the existing three-band customs import duty system, with rates of 0%,
    10%, and 15%, to 0%, 15%, and 20%, respectively.
   Continue the gradual phasing out of para-tariffs (first PAL, and then reduce
    CESS), aiming to eliminate them in 3-5 years. Appropriate trade adjustment
    package shall be introduced to ensure negative impact on domestic producers.

 All improvements to the revenue collection agencies are to be addressed in the background
 of the planned implementation of the Digital Public Infrastructure platform, described more
 fully in Chapter 7 (Public Sector Management and Digitalisation). We envisage all transactions
 between the revenue authorities and citizens would be completed on the DPI. Going beyond, we
 will relentlessly pursue the largest group of stakeholders to move away from cash transactions to
 digital payments.

 It is also essential to improve efficiency of state-owned enterprises (SOE) in order to generate
 sustainable revenue through dividends. SOE reforms are addressed further in Section 5
 (Expenditure Control).

  05            EXPENDITURE CONTROL

The IMF EFF program overly focuses on increasing revenue while neglecting spending cuts,
despite widespread concerns about wasteful government spending, waste, and corruption. Public
dissatisfaction with reforms, especially tax changes, stems from the government’s failure to
address spending. Therefore, fiscal consolidation should also include spending cuts and reforms
of SOEs. These measures can create fiscal space to strengthen social safety nets and boost
spending on important services such as education and healthcare. According to a UNDP study
(2024), only around 30% of respondents favoured increased taxes to deal with the debt issue, and
90% were of the view that the government should reduce spending and 80% believed that public
sector employment should be reduced.


5.1 RATIONALISE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE
Persistent problems in managing public spending, alongside failure to raise revenue, have led
to budget deficits, rising debt, and limited funds for infrastructure and social protection. The
SJB is committed to rationalizing public expenditure, focusing on efficiency, transparency, and
accountability in resource allocation. Additionally, we will conduct a management audit of public
sector employment and freeze new hiring until the audit is complete, with streamlined processes
for lower-level staff.

The new Public Finance Management Act (PFM) of 2024 prioritizes transparency and
accountability in expenditure, replacing the old Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act (FMRA)
of 2003. This strengthens the foundation for fiscal responsibility. The FMRA set limits on fiscal
deficits and government debt, aiming to keep the budget deficit below 5% of GDP by 2006 and
debt below 60%, but these were consistently exceeded without consequences. Clear penalties for
breaching targets and strict enforcement mechanisms are essential to ensure compliance and
accountability, beyond just legislative frameworks. We will follow the objectives of the PFM law
but with necessary amendments to ensure accountability. The arbitrary primary expenditure limit
with no connection to revenue shall be replaced with a more logical condition based on revenue
and the agreed upon medium term primary balance targets. Our goal is to use every public rupee
strategically for maximum value to the people.


 Intervention                                                                        Timeframe


 Data-driven planning: Within the PFM framework, implement a robust Medium-             S   M
 Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) using reliable forecasts and risk analyses to
 guide expenditure decisions based on sound data and future consideration. This
 analysis would reprioritise capital expenditure from the general budget on long-
 term projects such as roads and highways and remove all projects outside the
 National Physical Plan.
 Transparency and accountability in expenditure, to build public trust: Given the       S   M
 breakdown of the social contract and accusations of wastage and corruption, it is
 crucial we build back public trust in expenditure. This, combined with the MTEF
 can create a partnership between the government and the people on the direction
 and levels of expenditure. Specific initiatives include:

                                                                                     SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY



      Intervention                                                                              Timeframe
       Publishing transparent guidelines for all government spending including criteria
        for project approval.
       Involving relevant stakeholders, including the public, through consultations on
        significant expenditures.
       Establishing an online portal to publish all expenditure decisions and related
        documents in real-time, allowing for public access, scrutiny, and ongoing
        transparency.
       Conducting regular independent audits, with findings published publicly to
        ensure accountability and identify areas for improvement.
       Setting and adhering to strict timelines for each stage of the expenditure
        decision-making process to promote efficiency and reduce delays.
      Managing debt: As the largest component of recurrent expenditure will be interest           S       M
      even after the debt restructure, falling from 8.1% of GDP in 2024 to around 6.2%
      by 2029, debt management is critical. Discussion is in Section 2 (Managing the                  L
      Sovereign Debt Crisis).
      Expenditure reduction initiatives: We will consider every single line item in the           S       M
      budget to ensure they are needed. Those that can be removed shall be removed
      and others amended.
       Rationalizing the Cabinet of Ministers: We shall arrive at a prudent structure
        for the new Cabinet by removing the misalignment and fragmentation
        of Cabinets in the recent past. Based on expenditure rationalisation and
        efficiency we will arrive at a reasonable number of ministers and ministries
        within the stipulations of the Constitution.
       Cash transfers: Improve the mechanism to transfer cash to targeted                        S       M
        households in a more objective and transparent manner. The current
        Aswesuma program does not properly target the vulnerable and the needy,
        resulting in a large leakage of funds. We shall improve targeting using the
        latest data from the on-going population census and improve efficiency and
        ease of administration using the DPI platform. This is fully described in Section
        10 (Stronger Social Safety Nets) along with a more impactful poverty alleviation
        program, similar to the previous ‘Janasaviya’ program.
       Public infrastructure: Reallocate economic infrastructure expenditure to                  S       M
        facilitate the move from private to public transport. There is ample evidence to
        suggest expenditure on public transport such as rail and metro transport will                 L
        generate significant benefits to society at the present compared to excessive
        spending for private transport. The Kandy highway shall be completed but
        expansion beyond that will be based on a comprehensive assessment on
        priority. Improving the dilapidated rural road network shall be a policy priority
        as an integral part of rejuvenating the rural/agrarian economy. Besides public
        transport, the priority would be on irrigation, water supply and housing.
       Military spending: Sri Lanka has the 10th largest active military personnel per           M       L
        100 people in the world.13 We shall allow natural attrition in the military based
        on sound planning on defence requirements into the future, and ensure
        adequate funds are allocated for the maintenance of a high-quality life of
        veterans, particularly disabled veterans. We will consider possible savings to be
        reallocated to increase salaries in the public sector, starting with teachers.

  Vehicles: A low hanging fruit is government vehicle expenditure. Wasteful                S       M
   spending on vehicles will be stopped. A proper needs assessment of the public
   service and audit on the available vehicle fleet will be conducted, as exact
   numbers are not known. Strict guidelines shall be enforced on usage from the
   President downwards.
  Maintenance of politicians: There is a massive outcry that tax money should                  S
   not be ‘wasted’ on elected officials and in some cases former elected officials.
   We shall undertake a comprehensive audit on expenses on politicians and
   rationalise the same based on assessed security risks on each individual.
 New expenditure items: We plan to introduce several new expenditure items.                     S
 Significant new line items are:
 Increase in the Cost-of-Living allowance for public servants: Our government
 shall increase the monthly cost of living allowance to all eligible public sector
 employees to Rs. 25,000 per month from current amount Rs 17,800. This is based
 on the report of the Cabinet appointed Expert Committee on Public Service
 Salary Disparities. Note: The government announced this exact figure after the
 date for election was announced.
 Increase in basic salary for public servants: The minimum initial monthly salary               S
 for government service will increase by at least 24% (based on the current ratios
 for grades). This adjustment shall include any terms and conditions of various
 adjustments and allowances currently being enjoyed. Here again, the final
 amount shall be determined upon studying the fiscal data.
  The above two adjustments shall make the minimum gross salary in public
   service Rs. 57,500, including the cost-of-living allowance. Note: These figures
   (salary increment and COL increase) are strictly based on the interim report of
   the cabinet expert committee referred earlier to make recommendations on
   revising salaries across the public sector.
  Sakwala’ smart classrooms: Given top priority for building a Smart Sri Lanka,            S       M
   ensuring students’ access to digital learning platforms in schools shall be
   prioritised. This shall involve a total overhaul of delivering content using digital         L
   technology across all schools. This program shall be extended to technical and
   vocational institutions and universities. In addition to budgetary allocations, an
   innovative financing structure shall be introduced on twinning programs with
   schools overseas.
  ‘Husma’ support for hospitals: Our program to support hospitals across the               S       M
   country on life-saving medical equipment shall be streamlined into the health
   budget based on a complete assessment of need.                                               L

  Maternity leave benefits (MLB): Sri Lanka’s female labour force participation            S       M
   has remained around low 30% for a long time. Further, almost 80% of
   unemployed females are in the age group of 20-40 years. Even though we
   committed to MLB in 1952 through the ILO, we are yet to provide any funding
   at all for this purpose. We shall fund MLB either in full or partially depending
   on ability. We believe this would be a major impetus to improve the number of
   women in the labour force.
  Menstrual equity: Provision of subsidy (on a self-selected basis) for sanitary           S       M
   hygiene products for school-going girls. More on this is detailed in Section 10

 5.2 STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE REFORM
 Capital expenditure on long term projects has been adjusted, but the government has not
 rationalised other recurrent expenditure or imposed budget constraints on SOEs. Examples
 include giving bonuses to employees of loss making SOEs and spending exorbitant amounts of
 public funds. Through the broad reforms and specific interventions described below, many SOEs
 can transform from being taxpayer burdens to revenue generators, helping build a stronger and
 more sustainable economy for Sri Lanka.

 Establishing a SOE Holding Company is a key part of SOE reform, as this would remove SOEs from
 politicians’ control, a practice which leads to waste and corruption. This SOE Holding Company will
 provide a centralised and strategic framework for managing SOE ownership, under a structure
 similar to Singapore’s ‘Temasek model’. This company’s board will consist of the best available
 professionals appointed by the President with the concurrence of the Constitutional Council and
 will be managed by the best affordable talent available at a global level. It will consolidate selected
 SOEs, with ownership managed by the Secretary to the Treasury (ST).

 The Holding Company will prepare consolidated financial statements, while each SOE will
 develop strategic plans and budgets for themselves. These plans will outline goals, resource use,
 and strategies for improving market share, productivity, and financial independence, with Key
 Performance Indicators (KPIs) approved by their boards. What shareholding the ST shall hold in
 each of the SOEs shall be determined based on multiple objectives of the various stakeholders,
 balancing national and security interests with international competitiveness and efficiency.


  Intervention                                                                            Timeframe
  SOE Holding Company: Legislate and implement the SOE Holding Company                       S       M
  and place all selected SOEs under it, (a ‘Temasek’ type model), as described
  above. This naturally means some SOEs, based on criteria determined by the
  government, shall be outside the Holding company.
  Regulate SOEs not under the Holding Company:                                               S       M
   Impose hard budget constraints on SOEs not brought under the Holding
    Company. Begin to cease capital and current transfers to them.
   Via legislation, make it mandatory for SOEs not under the Holding Company
    to submit audited financial statements within the following financial year
    and shift all SOEs to accrual-based accounting. The objective is for these SOEs
    not to become a burden on the Treasury. Note: This has started but needs
    implementation and emphasis.
  Financing: Use risk-weighted lending by state banks for all SOEs until full                    S
  transformation.
  Liquidation: Liquidate insolvent SOEs by establishing an agency, structured as a               S
  trust or holding company, to take ownership of unviable SOEs. This agency will
  handle asset liquidation and settle creditors.
  Liberalization: Liberalize markets by introducing policies that allow private players          M
  to enter areas currently monopolized by state-owned enterprises.
  Airport management: Reform the management of airports to make them                             M
  attractive for all airlines. Price ground handling services in a manner that makes
  the airport attractive to low-cost carriers. Note: The government is in the process
  of privatising airports.

  06           INCENTIVISE GROWTH

Sri Lanka, once a model colony well-prepared for self-governance, initially benefited from a
strategic location, a strong export sector, a robust education system, and developed infrastructure.
For a time, it ranked among the most prosperous Asian nations. However, over the decades, its
economic growth lagged rapidly developing East Asian economies. By 2007,
Sri Lanka had transitioned from low-income to lower-middle-income status, and by 2019, to
upper-middle-income status, only to revert shortly thereafter.

From the late 1960s, Sri Lanka’s economic progress became less impressive due to slow growth.
The economy faced periods of macroeconomic instability, leading to frequent IMF interventions.
The Covid-19 pandemic precipitated an unprecedented sovereign debt crisis, with Sri Lanka
becoming the only Asian country to default on foreign debt in the past fifty years.

Political regimes in Sri Lanka have alternated between free-market policies and state-led
development strategies without a consistent, coherent national development approach. The
market-oriented reforms initiated in 1977, though promising, were incomplete. The escalation of
ethnic conflict from the early 1980s further hindered economic progress. Despite these challenges,
the economy grew at an average rate of 4% during the two decades following the reforms,
compared to 2.5% from 1960 to 1977. Manufacturing, particularly export-oriented, expanded, and
foreign direct investment played a crucial role. However, these reforms were insufficient to place
the economy on a sustainable growth path.

After the civil war ended in 2009, protectionist and interventionist policies gained momentum,
marking a departure from previous liberal policies. Trade policies became highly interventionist,
with import surcharges and politicized foreign investment approval processes. Large
infrastructure projects, often deemed ‘white elephants,’ were prioritized, funded by domestic
borrowing and money printing, which fueled inflation. This led to an ‘anti-tradable bias,’ favoring
non-tradable production over tradable production (manufacturing and agriculture). As a result,
tradable production’s share in GDP shrank to less than 20% by 2019, and exports of goods
and services as a percentage of GDP fell from about 30% in the early 2000s to about 15%. This
imbalance, combined with massive debt accumulation, contributed to the sovereign debt crisis.


Unshackling Domestic Markets
Our government is committed to transforming Sri Lanka into a globally connected market
economy, with private enterprise, both large and small, as the principal driver of growth. This
transformation requires two key actions: enhancing global economic integration through trade
liberalization and foreign direct investment, and unshackling domestic markets, including
product and labor markets. Ensuring effective market signals will enable full private sector
engagement in national development.

Government interventions, such as arbitrary price controls and licensing requirements, have
impeded the efficient operation of the private sector in domestic trade and production. The
SJB strategy involves gradually removing these interventions and limiting direct government
involvement to areas where markets fail and where support is necessary for vulnerable
populations.

 BLUEPRINT 3.0                                                                              TOWARDS AN ADVANCED
                                                                                           SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY


 Logistics infrastructure to connect small producers and traders to broader national markets
 will be enhanced through the development of rural road networks, public-private initiatives to
 improve supply-procurement networks, the establishment of climate-controlled-storage facilities
 for semi-perishable agricultural produce, and the expansion of digitally delivered services.

 Addressing long-standing price supports and fertilizer subsidies in the agricultural sector is a
 complex issue in market-oriented reforms. We believe that the goal is to rationalize these direct
 interventions and redirect government expenditures more toward agricultural extension services,
 irrigation infrastructure, and research. However, considering the reliance of farmers on these
 supports we shall consider reforms to improve transparency, and ensure equitable distribution of
 benefits among recipients.

 Sri Lanka’s labour laws, including generous severance pay clauses, require reform to become
 globally competitive. The SJB aims to increase labor market flexibility and responsiveness to global
 opportunities. More information on our proposed labour market reforms is in Section 8 (Factor
 Market reforms).


 Productivity Growth
 Low or even negative productivity growth—measured as the growth in output after accounting
 for the growth of inputs such as capital, labour, and intermediate inputs—has been a persistent
 issue in the Sri Lankan economy.14 In the long term, productivity growth is the key determinant of
 a country’s economic growth; relying solely on increasing inputs has natural limits.

 Productivity growth is an economy-wide phenomenon, making it impossible to design a specific
 program to achieve a set productivity target. The government’s role in promoting productivity
 growth is to create a conducive environment that allows the private sector to maximize gains
 from the inputs used in production. The SJB policy package is specifically designed to facilitate
 this.

 Trade liberalization enhances productivity in the domestic economy by exposing firms to
 international competition, allowing better exploitation of economies of scale through access
 to wider global markets, and enabling the use of superior technology embedded in imported
 inputs. Foreign companies that enter domestic manufacturing bring new technology, managerial
 practices, and forge new marketing links to penetrate global markets.

 To support this natural process of productivity enhancement through trade and investment
 liberalization, we will emphasize human capital development as a core of our development
 strategy. This includes training and skill development programs in collaboration with private
 sector firms, as well as providing financial and institutional support to universities, technical
 colleges and other higher educational institutions to launch professional training programs.




  The most widely used indicator of productivity is ‘labour productivity’, which is measured as production (normally
 14

 value added) per worker. The problem with this measure is that it spuriously captures capital per workers as a part of
 the measured productivity (‘A man with a bulldozer can dig a ditch faster than one with only a shovel’). Here we use the
 concept of total factor productivity (TFP), growth in output for all (combined) inputs.

                                                                            SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY


6.1 TRADE AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) POLICY
Excessive import restrictions hinders self-sustained growth by discouraging export production
and hampering productivity in import-competing production by sheltering it from import
competition. The domestic consumer has to bear the cost of inefficient domestic production. Our
government will be committed to gradually reducing these restrictions.

First, we shall replace quantitative restrictions (QR) with reasonably high (WTO consistent)
tariffs and then reduce tariffs towards uniform lower level as the balance of payments situation
improves. It is necessary to combine the import duty regime with rationalising the import
duty rebate schemes (including Board of Investment (BOI) provisions now coming under the
Economic Commission) to facilitate duty free access of imported inputs for export production.
Replacing QRs by tariffs has two important advantages: (a) it contributes to the government
budget by increasing tariff revenue (under QRs, quota rent goes to importers) and (b) it prevents
unscrupulous practices by import quota holders (who are basically cronies). It is also important to
replace most (if not all) specific import duties (specific duties, meaning charged per unit) with ad
valorem duties. Specie duties on consumer goods is anti-poor and also unnecessarily protect low
quality domestic production.

In 2022, strict regulations aimed at boosting export receipts included mandatory remittance and
conversion within 180 days and weekly sale of 25% of forex to the CBSL. These rules discouraged
export repatriation and reduced bank liquidity, disrupting exchange rate stability. We agree that
relaxing these regulations has increased foreign exchange inflow and stabilized the exchange rate.

Our government will supplement trade policy reforms with a top-level political effort to promote
export-oriented foreign direct investment (FDI). Sri Lanka’s experience under the liberalization
reforms initiated in the late 1970s, particularly the second-wave reforms in the early 1990s, has
clearly demonstrated the complementarity of trade and investment liberalization in the process of
export-oriented industrialization.

 for promoting FDI is nullified if they are not made strictly time-bound and
 transparent.

 to rationalise tariff structures. This aims to support local manufacturers and

  the WTO to establish and maintain a NSW to submit documents and data
  required to be submitted to authorities for the purpose of trade; import,
  export, and transhipment. Sri Lanka ratified the TF Agreement in 2016 and
  implementation of the NSW was to be completed between 2017 and 2022. But
  the current implementation date, according to various government sources,
  who themselves are confused or unaware, has been pushed back to 2030. It is
  obvious that there is no political will to complete this electronic trade portal for
  reasons best known to those blocking the same. Our government will break
  through the opposition by vested interest and lacklustre enthusiasm by officials
  to prioritise the NSW. The PDI will be most useful in ensuring the success of the
  NSW to implement even with a limited number of agencies onboard.

  Trade-cost adjustments: It is critical we implement trade adjustment facilities              M
  to mitigate potential socioeconomic impacts, such as unemployment or the
  reallocation of resources, which are crucial for fostering an export-oriented
  economic structure. These facilities should focus on both private and public
  sector adjustment costs.

     Export Processing Zones Infrastructure modernization: Establishing and                                   M
     upgrading Industrial Parks and Export Processing Zones (IP&EZs) is crucial.
     Since the first EPZ was established in Katunayake in 1978, only 15 EPZs have
     been added in the last 46 years. For comparison purposes: Philippines has 460
     EPZs, Vietnam 410 and India 615 and 92%, 89% and 74% respectively are privately
     owned whereas in Sri Lanka only 1 EPZ (MAS Fabric Park) is on a long lease from
     the government.
     Sri Lanka made several mistakes in developing EPZ infrastructure. Successive
     governments under-invested in both the amount and quality of EPZs; they
     exclusively relied on public resources to develop and manage EPZs and they
     did not establish appropriate regulations for their effective management.
     The government recently legislated the Economic Transformation Act which
     provides for a new framework for EPZs to be set up as private or PPP zones
     under a new entity called ZonesSL. While the move is positive in general the
     legislation needs further enhancement so that our EPZs can compete in the
     region. Our approach shall be threefold. One to enact separate, overarching
     legislation to govern EPZs. Second, enhance the quality of the EPZs by
     incorporating minimum standards and minimum criteria for selecting investors
     and third, preventing conflicts of interest by ensuring regulatory independence.15

     These reforms we believe will attract high-tech and high-value-added industries
     by providing comprehensive facilities and support systems (such as enhanced
     waste and emission management and logistical services) that are key in helping
     investors decide where to plug and play. Our objective is to encourage EPZs in
     all districts and all Divisional Secretariat Divisions.

 6.2 AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND LIVESTOCK: MULTI-
 DIMENSIONAL REFORMS
 Modernizing agriculture via digitalization
 Agriculture is crucial to Sri Lanka’s economy, employing over 26% of the population and supporting
 two-thirds of the rural population. However, agricultural performance has been disappointing,
 with an average annual growth rate of only around 1% over the past four decades and much lower
 productivity relative to manufacturing and services Consequently, poverty is heavily concentrated
 in rural agricultural areas.

 We must address challenges at multiple levels. Archaic laws need modernization. Reforms will
 unshackle agriculture markets through the Bim Saviya program, provide equitable water access
 via refurbished irrigation tanks, and offer access to finance and insurance. For the individual
 farmer, the entire value chain—from obtaining information on what, how much, and when to
 produce, to financing inputs and managing the cultivation cycle—needs improvement. Thereafter,
 post-harvest management in terms of storage to logistics to sale must be addressed.

 We will implement a rapid, technology-driven agricultural modernization program to reduce
 rural poverty, increase productivity, and promote sector growth. This includes interventions – in
 paddy, vegetable, and plantation crops – from planting to sale, such as protected agriculture, drip
 irrigation, and perhaps even AI-assisted hydroponic farming.

 The core of this modernization program will be the Govi Gnana Seva Program (GGS, meaning
 ‘Farmer Knowledge Service’) which shall become the comprehensive digital ecosystem for
 agriculture information and transacting, transforming current ad-hoc methods. GGS will not only
 remove the information asymmetry between the farmer and the by providing crucial data on spot
 and forward prices and on supply and demand for produce, weather patterns, soil conditions, and
 best practices as well as links to banks, insurance companies and logistics providers. Access to
 GGS will be on the ubiquitous mobile telephone. The GGS digital ecosystem will allow producers
 to sell future harvest contracts and provide financial stability through guaranteed prices. Smart
 contracts, powered by blockchain, will automate transactions and mitigate fraud risks, helping
 farmers become independent from loan sharks.

 This information system will link to a DPI based network of climate-controlled storage warehouses
 and transportation options. Collaborating with the private sector, we will build this network to
 reduce post-harvest losses, increase producer profits, and reduce retail costs, facilitating access
 to lucrative export markets. The entire process will run on the DPI. A nationwide awareness and
 training program will equip stakeholders with necessary skills.

          How would the Govi Gnana Seva work?
          The most common start-up feature would be to check live prices in various markets. Say, a farmer
          from Matale can use his smartphone to check current onion prices at the Dambulla market,
          helping him decide whether to transport or sell locally. GGS will connects farmers to irrigation
          schedules, seed dealers, fertilizer agents, weather updates.. It will also allow farmers to study
          future demand and enter in to forward sales agreements (FSA) with supermarket buyers to deliver
          at a later date. These FSAs can then be used as collateral to obtain a working capital loans from
          banks, freeing farmers from the clutches of the middlemen traders. The FSA will make it possible
          for insurance companies to determine premiums for crop insurance. Farmers can also find and
          enter into logistics agreements for transportation of produce in safely packed containers into a
          climate-controlled warehouses. The uses of the GGS will only be limited by imagination.



In total, the proposed technological transformation of Sri Lanka’s agricultural, fisheries, and
livestock sectors is expected to yield increased earnings for stakeholders., improved access to
fresh, high-quality food for consumers, and enhanced economic prosperity in rural communities.

A more comprehensive discussion on agriculture will be provided in a separate agriculture
policy document. From the point of view of fiscal support, we will provide investment relief for
agriculture modernization and revise the VAT on agriculture machinery. A key support for small
and medium scale farmers shall be the provision of fuel and fertilizer subsidies via a QR based
cash transfer mechanism based on a means tested basis.

          Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector faces high post-harvest losses (estimated at 40%) and price volatility.
          To address this, the government started to build a 5,000 MT temperature and humidity-controlled
          warehouse in Dambulla (in 2019) to provide affordable storage solutions to stabilize prices,
          reduce losses, and support farmers. Named Prabashwara, this was a collaboration between the
          government, private sector, farming community, and the Indian government (which provided
          initial funding) and was to be proof of concept for the efficiency of modern climate controlled
          agri-logistics. It was to revolutionize the agricultural supply chain by minimizing post-harvest
          losses, enhancing farmer income, expanding market reach, stimulating private investment, and
          encouraging sustainable practices. Although the previous government halted construction from
          2019 to 2022 and the new government since 2022 continued to ignore the project, our efforts from
          the opposition have nearly completed it. The next steps involve inviting operators to manage the
          warehouse and launching an awareness and training campaign to ensure farmers engage in good
          agricultural practices (GAP)-compliant produce for storage at Prabashwara.



Investing in fisheries
Sri Lanka’s fisheries industry faces challenges such as price fluctuations, inconsistent quality,
and supply chain difficulties but holds significant potential. Our strategy includes leveraging
technology through an upgraded Dialog DEWN app with accurate, localized weather forecasts
and expanding the GGS Program for real-time data on fish migration and market prices. We
will invite private enterprise investments in cold chain infrastructure to ensure high-quality fish
reaches both domestic and international markets, promoting sustainable practices to protect
marine resources and responsible fishing methods.

 Renewing the livestock sector
 The livestock sector is crucial for food security, rural development, and environmental
 sustainability. Integrating this sector into the GGS Program will provide over 600,000 small-
 scale farmers with access to real-time information on animal health, best practices, and market
 prices, improving productivity and marketing. Targeted policies will promote sustainable animal
 husbandry, enhance feed production and distribution, and boost rural livelihoods through
 financial and technical support.



           The All-Island Shakthi Rice Cooperative, Polonnaruwa
           The government introduced ‘Shakthi Rice’ in March 2019 to support small and medium-scale
           (SME) rice millers and protect farmers and consumers. Structured as a cooperative of about 300
           SME millers, the initiative provided a Rs 1 billion working capital fund, enabling millers to buy
           paddy at competitive prices, mill it in the hundreds of SME rice mills and sell rice affordably. This
           effort reopened closed SME mills, improved rice quality, and set a price ceiling, forcing large millers
           to lower their prices. Despite its success, the program was discontinued. Our government will
           reintroduce and expand the Shakthi model to cover as many millers as possible.



 Breaking the rice miller oligopoly
 One of the main reasons for the high prices for rice, the staple food of Sri Lankans, is the lack of
 competition in the rice milling industry. The market is being controlled by a handful of millers who
 manipulate the market for rice. This ‘mafia’ has to be broken. For years the government has tried
 to intervene in the market via the state-owned Paddy Marketing Board but failed miserably due to
 corruption, politicisation and lack of interest. Our solution lies in building a strong SME cooperative
 to fight the oligopoly. Our government will provide the necessary initial financial support via a
 rolling working capital facility by reintroducing the Shakthi rice cooperative scheme to ensure a
 sustained competition in this market.

   Accelerate the Bim Saviya Program or replace it with an alternate to provide
   secure land titling and ownership. This would subsequently become a total
   land database which would be segmented by a land use plan based on a
   comprehensive and consultative process. This will enable farmers to gain
   autonomy to make decisions about their land and facilitate independent access
   to financial resources.

   Review existing legislation and introduce more private land ownership through
   the divestiture of surplus state-owned lands.Continue and expand the current
   Urumaya program to provide freehold titles.

   Liberalization: Establish PPPs, encourage FDI, and ensure access to finance for                        M
   farmers to collaborate. Multinational involvement opens market channels across
   the world and enables our farmers to international standards and export.

 6.3 INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT:
 CONNECTING TO GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS
 Breaking walls and building bridges to the world
 The global manufacturing landscape has changed dramatically over the past half-century with
 the expansion of global manufacturing value chains (GMVCs) or Global Production Networks
 (GPNs). Now, final products particularly in electronics, automotive, machinery, and precision goods
 industries, often consist of components produced in several countries. This phenomenon opens
 up opportunities for countries to engage in specific segment in the GMVC depending on their
 relative cost advantage, instead of producing a good from the beginning to end within its national
 boundaries. The bulk of manufacturing exports from the high performing East Asian economies
 take place within GMVCs.

 In apparels as we have experienced in Sri Lanka, local entrepreneurs have the opportunity to
 penetrate global markets through links forged with international buyers, with or without FDI
 involvement. But in GMVCs in electronics and electrical industries, production sharing takes place
 through intra-firm linkages, rather than in an arm’s-length manner. Intra-firm linkages are vital
 for preserving technological secrecy and to ensure quality of parts and components produced in a
 given location, which is vital to maintain quality standards of the final product. Therefore, FDI plays
 a vital role in a country’s participation in GMVCs in these industries and are usually referred to as
 producer driven GMVCs.

 These processes are usually organized by multinational enterprises (MNEs) with subsidiaries or
 subcontractors across countries. Trade within GMVCs accounts for half to two-thirds of world
 merchandise trade and over two-thirds of manufacturing trade between developing and
 developed countries.

 Given GMVCs operate based on each country’s cost advantage, Sri Lanka, with its abundant
 trainable labor and strategic location, can engage strongly in labor-intensive tasks within GMVCs.

 However, successful participation depends on the costs of ‘service links’—arrangements for
 coordinating activities within GMVCs—being lower than the cost savings from production abroad.
 A conducive policy regime and investment climate are also crucial to mitigate ‘country risks’ like
 shipping delays, political disturbances, or labor disputes.

 The below graph clearly depicts what our challenge is. While the developing countries’ share in
 global exports, increased from about 17% in 1976 to over 50% by 2020, Sri Lanka’s share went up
 from 0.02% to close to 0.3% in the mid-1990s only to fall to less than 0.15% by 2020 as the economy
 built in an anti-tradable (anti-export) bias. Our government’s policy is to reverse this trend and
 incentivize the tradables (essentially exports) sector as more fully described in Chapter 6.1 (Trade
 and Foreign Direct Investment Policy).

The SJB’s export-oriented industrialization strategy aims to integrate Sri Lanka into GMVCs by
creating an attractive environment for global manufacturers. Key focuses include:

 Consistent policy environment focusing on the tradable sector and proving constitutional
  guarantees on property rights.
 Creating and maintaining a stable macro-economy with a favorable real exchange rate regime to
  ensure international competitiveness.
 Streamlining regulations to create a business-friendly environment, ensuring previously referred
  to trade facilitation and single window is established.
 Ensuring fair treatment in enforcing the law equally to all players and fast conclusion of
  commercial disputes through arbitration.
 Developing a significantly large pool of skilled and trainable labor and management to engage
  in specialized global manufacturing tasks.
 Building necessary infrastructure, including new high quality privately or PPP run Export
  Processing Zones (EPZs). We will focus on establishing EPZs in all districts and incentivize setting
  up products and facilities in as many DS divisions.
 Focus on attracting producer-driven technology based FDIs into the EPZs. Our government
  will engage at the highest level to promote Sri Lanka to investors using all available avenues.
  Bringing in one major player will encourage others to consider Sri Lanka.
 Providing essential services to promote exports and collaborations via a well-functioning Export
  Development Board that avails companies to engage with potential buyers at global marketing
  fairs and bilateral meetings.
 Providing competitive incentives.

 Strengthening global economic ties and participating in shared value chains will boost our
 export potential, attract investments, and enhance global competitiveness. Additionally, these
 partnerships will facilitate knowledge transfer, technological collaboration, and the development
 of skilled human capital.


 Integrating into the global electronics value chain
 Following the liberalization reforms of the late 1970s, multinational enterprises saw Sri Lanka’s
 potential in the global electronics value chain. Two major electronics multinationals, Motorola
 and Harris Corporation, set up operations in the Katunayake Export Processing Zone (KEPZ).
 However, both left in the early 1980s due to political instability. If these two MNEs were to operate
 successfully in KEPZ, other electronics multinationals would have followed suit given the well-
 know ‘herd mentality’ in site selection by multinational electronics firms. Despite this over
 30 medium-scale export-oriented firms have successfully operated in Sri Lanka’s electronics,
 electrical goods, and auto parts industries, employing over 20,000 workers and generating
 exports worth about $1 billion by the late 2010s. These firms produce a range of components and
 are fully or partially owned by companies from Japan, Germany, Sweden, Australia, and the USA.
 The availability of trainable labor and supervisory and managerial personnel has been a major
 attraction for these investors.16

 Their success, even in a challenging environment, indicates Sri Lanka’s potential to become an
 electronics hub with systematic policy reforms and investment promotion. Amid the US-China
 trade war and global chip shortage, Sri Lanka could be an attractive alternative manufacturing
 location, particularly as the global semiconductor market is projected to reach $1 trillion by 2030.
 Sri Lanka is well positioned to gain from the ongoing process of strategic realignment in GMVC in
 the context of global production as Vietnam and Cambodia, and more recently India have already
 been doing. Recently Foxconn, the major contract manufacturer for Apple, set up a plant in
 Chennai to assemble iPhones. This was part of Foxconn strategic move to reduce dependence on
 China as its assembly base, in response to the strained US-China relationship.


 Further enhancing the success of the apparel sector
 Following the liberalization reforms of the late 1970s, Sri Lanka’s apparel industry evolved into a
 modern, competitive sector, thriving even after the 2004 abolition of quota protection under the
 Multi-Fibre Arrangement. It contributes over 5% to GDP and 40% of total merchandise exports,
 directly employing over 350,000 workers. Currently about 60% of fabric used in apparel production
 is produced domestically. Over the years, the industry developed a rich customer base at the
 upper end of the apparel value chain, and it has remarkably evolved from ‘basic apparel’ stitching
 standard men’s shirts and trousers to ‘fashion basic’ where they design and develop and deliver
 articles such as lingerie and intimate wear which are variants of basic products that contain
 fashion elements. It is now moving to even more sophistication with wearable technology and
 more. In this process, large apparel firms have established their own design centres which work
 closely with design teams of brand owners. Most large companies engage in computer-aided
 manufacturing and electronic fitting. However, the industry faces significant challenges that
 require strong policy and leadership commitment is crucial for the continued growth and global
 competitiveness of Sri Lanka’s apparel sector.

Advanced Technology
The future we wish to create in Sri Lanka for our youth is one they would love to live in. A place
where they can work or become entrepreneurs in exciting new fields, create wealth, enjoy life
and do good. We will make all endeavours to help make this nation a centre of global technology
and innovation. Our government will fully support our young tech entrepreneurs to transform Sri
Lanka into the birthplace of the next Google, Samsung, or Tesla within the next five years.

We will focus on technology beyond IT into numerous other fields, be it agritech; the application
of technology and AI to make farming more efficient, from field monitoring to the food supply
chain, biotech; the use of biology to develop new products, methods and organisms intended
to improve human health, nanotech; to design, produce, and use structures and devices by
manipulating atoms and molecules at nanoscale, or wearable tech; to produce electronic devices
that can be worn as accessories, embedded in clothing, implanted in the user’s body, or even
tattooed on the skin and many other areas of innovation. There are so many areas in which
technology is being used to leverage productivity increases multiple fold.

Another exciting opportunity that we can exploit is in unlocking the potential of our graphite.
Sri Lanka boasts the world’s purest vein graphite, with purity levels of 99%. Historically a leading
supplier, current production is less than 1% of the global market. This high-purity graphite is ideal
for producing graphene, a material enhancing electronics, construction materials, paints, plastics,
water purification, and lubricants. Graphene can also extend lithium-ion battery life and speed
up charging times. Sri Lanka can capitalize on this by processing raw graphite into high-value
graphene. The Sri Lanka Institute of Nano Technology (SLINTEC) is collaborating with a local
startup on graphene technologies. Focusing on value-added processing, sustainable practices,
and partnerships with major graphene consumers can open new markets and solidify Sri Lanka’s
position as a reliable supplier. Our government would fully support this transformation by
enacting legislation on the use of supply critical material and promoting responsible practices.



         Putting Sri Lanka on the map for autonomous transportation,
         aviation, and robotics.
         “Over the past few years, we at Qbits have made significant advancements in research and
         development. Our cutting-edge system allows drones to make autonomous decisions using
         onboard cameras. These drones can navigate complex environments, such as weaving between
         trees and manoeuvring through narrow spaces, entirely on their own. Our next step is to enhance
         these drones to operate at high speeds with rapid acceleration and deceleration on rough terrains,
         making swift decisions. Additionally, if the drone encounters a deadlock path, it will reanalyse and
         change its course, even without prior knowledge of the terrain. Our algorithms handle critical
         functions, including visual odometry, sensor fusion, localization and mapping, obstacle detection,
         and path planning. These capabilities are essential for next-generation drones and robots
         equipped with onboard AI. Our system runs on a custom carrier board designed and developed
         by us. It boasts impressive onboard processing power, featuring 384 CUDA cores, 48 Tensor cores,
         a 6-core CPU, and 21 TOPs, operating at nearly 2 GHz.” Dr Harsha Subasinghe, Tech entrepreneur.

   Regional Center for Technology as a special economic zone for service.

 Participating in and hosting global investor events: Only people with money
 would consider investing. Hence, we must regularly participate in events
 overseas and host events to bring together these would be investors to Sri
 Lanka. For example, the Global Wealth Conference held in London last May
 consisted of 250 Billionaires who ended up investing USD 18 billion. We plan to
 undertake similar events.

 called the ‘Global Entrepreneurship Monitor’ which feeds the world bank with
 more accurate entrepreneurship data. This will give us better insights into
 entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka and this data will enrich policy making towards

 Liberalization of shipping. The debate on liberalizing the shipping industry                 S
 has been going on for too long. A decision must be made, and we must move
 on. We will engage in one final round of discussion with all stakeholders in
 the shipping business on amending the Licensing of Shipping Agencies Act
 to permit over 50% of equity of shipping agency business to principals if they
 propose to invest stipulated minimum investment in agency and related
 business activities as provided for in the FDI entry policy. The objective is to
 create further efficiency for international trade without negatively impacting
 existing agency business. Further, we were opposed to amending the law to
 give authority to the Minister of Ports to regulate the tariff payable to shipping
 agencies. We will revise this legislation to bring in competition.



6.4 SERVICES: A KEY ECONOMIC DRIVER
Sri Lanka’s services industry plays a pivotal role in the economy, encompassing diverse sectors like
tourism, logistics, telecommunications, and IT. Among these, the IT/BPM sector has emerged as
a leader in growth and innovation, contributing 7.4% to the nation’s total exports in 2022. Despite
this progress, Sri Lanka’s technological infrastructure remains underdeveloped, presenting both a
challenge and an opportunity.

An SJB government envisions transforming Sri Lanka’s dynamic services industry into a global
digital powerhouse. Imagine tourists effortlessly booking experiences through innovative online
platforms, alongside a bustling online marketplace where local professionals connect with
global clients. Web developers, graphic designers, data analysts, and other skilled workers will
have opportunities to benefit from the global digital economy. This shift will not only create new
employment opportunities, particularly for women, but also drive economic growth by integrating
Sri Lanka into the global market. This vision can be realized by fostering a thriving ecosystem
for digitally delivered services, integrating our natural and cultural assets with cutting edge
technology.


Advancing IT and E-Commerce
We have proven over the last four years in opposition that IT is crucial to advance in life. This we did
with our ‘Sakwala’ program where we contributed to 385 schools by way of establishing a smart
classroom in each school. It goes without saying our commitment to equipping students with IT
skills to successfully face the challenges in the global marketplace.

In terms of the economy, the introduction of the ubiquitous DPI will create enormous
opportunities in e-commerce and IT. Thus far unavailable services will become possible. These will
include hundreds of government-to-citizen services at all levels of government down to the local
council and perhaps thousands of others between business and business and consumers. The
limit shall only be the ability to dream.

From a policy perspective, simplifying regulations, lowering barriers for new entrants, and
streamlining operations for businesses will create a more competitive landscape. By aligning with
international norms, particularly in payment processing, Sri Lanka can integrate secure, globally
recognized payment gateways, boosting consumer and merchant confidence.

 Improving the national logistics network, including last-mile delivery services and international-
 standard warehousing, is essential for maintaining competitiveness. The development of
 e-commerce Export Hubs through public-private partnerships will create concentrated zones
 of activity with superior infrastructure, fostering innovation and efficiency. The ‘Digital Export
 Champion Scheme’ will train local businesses in digital marketing and international practices,
 helping them scale up and access global markets.

 It is also important to foster a thriving IT/BPM startup ecosystem. Sri Lanka’s IT-BPM sector has
 seen substantial and rapid growth, with revenues surpassing US$1.3 billion, employing over 80,000
 individuals, and accounting for 12% of Sri Lanka’s service export earnings.

 Investing in education and training to equip the workforce with relevant skills, such as software
 development and data analytics, is also critical. Collaboration among startups, established
 companies, academic institutions, and government bodies will drive growth, positioning Sri Lanka
 as a leader in the global digital economy.

   Encourage innovation and research and development in technology:                         S   M
   Besides interventions foron Advanced Technology we shall provide generous
   support to leverage human resources to IT and e-commerce industry.
   Specifically,
    Help seek out talent and provide support to get started by launching
     national level competitions and challenges to scout for innovative ideas
     and solutions.
    Integrate entrepreneurship into academic institutions by setting up start-
     up centres and promoting student-led start-ups. We will redouble efforts
     to build collaborations between local and foreign universities to have short
     crash-courses on practical entrepreneurship programs that end with
     ‘investor days’ where student startups seek angel funding from investors.
    Provide comprehensive support for start-ups, from ideation to prototyping
     and beyond.
    Create technology business incubators to facilitate the transformation of
     innovations into viable businesses.
    Provide incentives to develop domestic software and already existing
     software companies, monitoring progress and renewing incentives
     accordingly.


 Transforming Sri Lanka into a Logistics Hub
 Sri Lanka’s strategic location, with deep-water ports in Colombo and Trincomalee, offers immense
 potential to become a logistics hub in the Indian Ocean, considering that over 50% of global trade
 volume travels within 12 nautical miles of our shores. However, the Port of Colombo is struggling to
 maintain its competitiveness globally: this requires significant technological transformation and
 strategic alliances.

 Our vision is to transform Sri Lanka into a logistics powerhouse, driven by the Digital Port Initiative,
 which aims to streamline processes, reduce clearance times, and modernize port infrastructure.
 By automating key processes and integrating cutting-edge technologies, Sri Lankan ports can
 become more attractive to international shipping lines. Additionally, the natural deep-water

harbour at Trincomalee holds significant potential for expansion, with plans to develop the
Colombo-Trincomalee Economic Corridor (CTEC) as a vital artery connecting production centers
with key ports and markets.

To attract major shipping alliances, Sri Lanka must build strategic partnerships and tailor its
offerings to better integrate with global networks. We will prioritize collaboration with these
alliances, understanding their needs and concerns, and streamlining crew and cargo movement
through smart travel facilitation systems. The discussion on integrating with global value chains is
relevant here as well.

Transforming Sri Lanka into a thriving logistics hub in the Indian Ocean will not only generate
substantial revenue but also create high-paying jobs, boost our economy, and solidify Sri Lanka’s
position as a key player in the global maritime landscape.


Reinvigorating Tourism for Economic Growth
Tourism has historically been a cornerstone of Sri Lanka’s economy, ranking as the third-largest
foreign exchange earner. However, the Covid-19 pandemic and economic challenges caused a
severe downturn in 2020, crippling the tourism supply chain. To revive tourism, Sri Lanka must
differentiate itself through destination rebranding and digital transformation.

We will help the industry to leverage non-price-based strategies, such as highlighting its cultural
heritage, natural beauty, and unique experiences. With this the country can carve out a distinctive
identity and appeal to travellers seeking authentic and immersive experiences. This involves
strategic marketing campaigns, storytelling, and experiential tourism offerings that resonate
with target markets. By catering to specialty markets and developing niche tourism segments
such as spiritual tourism, Ayurveda tourism, and wellness tourism, Sri Lanka can attract high-
value travellers seeking unique and personalised experiences. With the entry of Sri Lanka’s first
integrated resort with a highly recognized international gaming brand the country can expect a
further boom to the number of tourists to the country. However, it is our strong position that all
casinos should be brough under a gaming regulator that must be legislated and implemented
without delay.

Embracing digital transformation is essential for the tourism industry. This includes streamlining
visa processes, border controls, and security measures through digital solutions. Additionally,
developing smart destinations leveraging technologies like Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial
Intelligence (AI), and blockchain will manage tourist flows, create personalized experiences, and
ensure efficient resource management. Promoting widespread adoption of digital payment
systems will enhance the tourist experience by eliminating the need for currency exchange and
ATM fees. Investing in digital skills training programs for the workforce and supporting tourism-
focused startups will foster innovation within the sector.

Sri Lanka’s hotel infrastructure, with an average age of 15-20 years, faces challenges in competing
with regional rivals like the Maldives and Thailand. Strategic investments are needed to modernize
facilities and enhance competitiveness. Also, recognizing the global trend towards eco-tourism,
Sri Lanka has the potential to become a leader in sustainable travel practices. By promoting eco-
friendly tourism initiatives and ensuring responsible environmental practices, we aim to position
Sri Lanka as a top destination for conscious travelers.

  Regulations: Reform regulations to eliminate entry barriers for start-ups and             S
  technology-driven firms in the tourism industry, particularly the stringent
  requirements for business registration under the Sri Lanka Tourism Development
  Authority (SLTDA). Streamline licensing processes and digitising transactions to

  Financial support: Given the high stage 3 loans in the tourism industry, we plan          S
  to provide some level of special consideration for this key foreign exchange
  generating sector when initiating debt moratoriums or Parate actions by banks.
  We also plan to amend legislation to enable debt to equity swaps in these
  properties.
  Infrastructure investment: We will work towards enabling long term funds with             M
  longer repayment terms to be extended for refurbishment, accommodation
  upgrades in the tourism industry to ensure the provision of high-quality

 6.5 MICRO, SMALL, AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES (MSMEs)
 AND START-UPS
 Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) are vital to Sri Lanka’s economy, comprising
 about 80% of enterprises, contributing 52% to GDP, and providing 45% of jobs. Despite their
 significance, the SME sector in Sri Lanka predominantly operates informally, and face various
 challenges that stifle growth and competitiveness. Our vision focuses on creating a vibrant MSME
 ecosystem that fosters innovation, growth, and job creation. This involves integrating MSMEs into
 value chains linked to the organized industrial sectors, enhancing market access, technology
 transfer, and capacity building.

 To improve productivity and global competitiveness of MSMEs, we will revamp vocational
 education and training programs. This includes upgrading training facilities, collaborating with
 industry experts, and establishing partnerships for apprenticeship and on-the-job training. Despite
 women constituting over 50% of the population, they represent only 25% of entrepreneurs. Special
 initiatives will be introduced to support women and youth in MSMEs through capacity building,
 financial access, and networking opportunities.

 Discussion on the financial issues being faced by the MSME sector and proposed solutions under
 an SJB government is in Section 2.3 (Ensuring financial stability while dealing with NPL crisis).
 The issue of ‘development banking’ for MSME as well as others is detailed in Section 9.3 (Capital:
 Boost inflows and strengthen the domestic debt market). Beyond the above we plan the following
 interventions:

  Extension of the suspension of Parate’ executions
 We plan to extend the suspension initially for 6 months from 15 December 2024. Thereafter, based
 on a balance of loan recovery and enterprise support, we shall work with the financial institutions
 and the treasury to arrive at a permanent solution to the crisis, encompassing legal and financial
 structures.

Creating a start-up revolution
In our future Government, fostering entrepreneurship will be central to driving economic
growth and job creation. We plan to ignite a start-up revolution in Sri Lanka by focusing on
two critical resources: talent and funding. To unlock funding, we will enhance access to early-
stage investments like Angel funding and create policies to attract both capital and skilled
entrepreneurs. We will develop a robust product and intellectual property (IP) ecosystem, improve
IP and patenting laws, and establish a favourable tax and regulatory framework to draw foreign
investment.

For overseas investors, we will enable them to leverage Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements
(DTAA) for tax credits. Additionally, we will reform legislation to attract top professionals for
managing VC funds by removing double taxation and categorizing carried interest as capital
gains. This approach will position Sri Lanka as a thriving hub for startup investment and VC
activity.

 amend laws to create new funding sources.
  Work with financial institutions to create specialized loan products and equity           M
   financing options for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
  To create a high-growth venture capital (VC) ecosystem (most countries with
   successful startups have such mechanisms), we plan to setup a special task
   force to advice the government on possible new structures including tax pass-
   throughs that allows VCs to deduct tax at source with the remaining balance
   returned to investors.
 ‘Buy Local’ Campaign: Launch a campaign to promote and support locally owned            S       M
 businesses, while helping make them internationally competitive.
 Incentives for Local Sourcing: Offer incentives and preferential procurement
 policies for government agencies and large corporations to source from local                M
 SMEs.

 Financial Literacy Promotion: Conduct educational campaigns and workshops to                M
 improve financial literacy and responsible investing practices.
 Local Stock Exchange: Establish within the Colombo Stock Exchange, a local              M       L
 exchanges to provide a platform for SMEs to raise equity capital, support
 innovation, and stimulate regional economic development. Simplify the listing
 process and set criteria for local ownership, fair wages, and sustainability
 standards.
 Improve Financial Access: Enhance access to finance for SMEs by addressing                  M
 collateral requirements and high interest rates. Promote private investment
 under favourable conditions and implement a revised Microfinance Act to
 strengthen the sector to attract FDI.

                PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT
  07            AND DIGITALISATION
7.1 PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM
Efficient and equitable public provision of health, education and social services is vital form
economic development and civil security. Sri Lanka’s public sector is responsible for providing
these services. Yet although it is massive, with nearly 1.5 million employees, it is plagued by
overlapping roles, redundancy, and underpayment. Decades of reform have failed to address
corruption and accountability issues, from public procurement to service delivery. Political
interference in recruitment, often driven by election promises, has led to mass employment,
creating a sense of entitlement to public sector jobs, resulting in strikes and work to rule
campaigns for sometimes totally unreasonable demands.

A complete overhaul of the public sector work culture is needed, starting with leadership.
Streamlining the Cabinet and ministries to reduce fragmentation and redundancy is a first step.
We propose a logical structuring of around 27 ministries. Eliminating duplications and needless
bureaucratic linkages, and improving coordination between ministries and agencies, will improve
efficiency and reduce expenditure and waste.

Expanding the Public Services Commission’s scope to include administrative reforms and
strengthening independent regulatory bodies is essential for oversight and management. SOE
and pensions reforms will support this effort. Unfunded public sector pensions with very high
pay-out ratios are no longer sustainable and must move towards funded pension schemes at the
national scale, rather than for the public sector alone.


 Intervention                                                                        Timeframe
 Public sector recruitment: Undertake a comprehensive audit of personnel                  S
 requirements across the state, armed forces, and SOEs. Any lower-level
 recruitment should prioritize hiring from the existing state worker cadre (green
 sheeting). Re-examine and reassess defence expenditure.
 KPIs: Develop outcome-based KPIs for the public sector to measure success and           M
 drive performance improvements.
 Capacity building: Engage in capacity building for retained public sector               M
 employees, particularly high-level staff, and establish mechanisms to hire mid-
 career professionals into public service roles.
 Financial management: Gradually shift the public sector from cash-basis                  L
 accounting to accrual-basis accounting.

 7.2 THE DIGITAL PUBLIC SECTOR INITIATIVE
 Digitalization will be the most significant disruptor of the status quo, enhancing efficiency,
 reducing corruption, and lowering service provision costs. These savings, combined with
 improved service delivery, can reduce the tax burden on citizens, fostering economic recovery
 and sustainable growth. Embracing digitalization is vital for fiscal responsibility and economic
 resilience, linking public sector reforms to create a more responsive, accountable, and efficient
 government.

 The Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) initiative is central to this transformation, aiming to create
 a set of open APIs called a ‘Lanka Stack.’ This interoperable platform will serve as a public good,
 allowing the public and private sectors to address various daily issues for citizens by ‘stacking’ of
 programs on top of each other.

 The DPI will consist of three components: a unique verifiable identification of each individual; the
 ability to transfer and receive value (payment); and consented sharing of personal data.

 The DPI will completely transform the public sector. Starting with the Registrar of Persons, the DPI
 platform will become the primary interface for every transaction between government, business
 and citizens. Early services will be implementation of an efficient social safety net distribution
 module with the Welfare Benefits Board for cash transfers for all types of government support to
 households, and a system to pay all types of government dues, be it taxes, rates, fines, levies etc.
 Instead of separate solutions for each problem, shared technological components will be reused
 across different applications.

 Inspired by India’s ‘Aadhaar’ program, we will first implement features to eliminate corruption
 in revenue collection, benefit transfers, and public procurement. Embracing DPI enables
 efficient, secure data handling, improves service delivery, and protects citizens’ privacy through
 consent-driven data sharing. Prioritizing digitalisation aligns the public sector with cutting-edge
 technology, making governance in Sri Lanka more effective, transparent, and resilient against
 corruption.

 DPI and the Lanka Stack will evolve into a consent-driven ecosystem for sharing personal data,
 ensuring privacy protection and enabling seamless financial interactions. Eventually, it will support
 a wide range of public and private transactions among millions of people daily; from paying for a
 vehicle registration while sitting in your home, to negotiating with a bank to purchase a TV before

 By adopting DPI, we aim to transform Sri Lanka’s public sector, improve service delivery, and
 create a transparent, accountable, and efficient governance system.

 leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) is also important. A key feature of AI is its ability to recognize
 patterns and predict outcomes from large datasets. This allows governments to conduct more
 comprehensive analyses of public sector data, identify trends, anticipate results, and develop
 evidence-based policies. By providing real-time data and predictive analytics, AI can significantly
 enhance the effectiveness of public policy.

         Digital Innovation in the Healthcare Sector - 1990 Suwa Seriya
         1990 Suwa Seriya exemplifies the transformative power of digitalization in public services in
         Sri Lanka. Central to its success is the seamless integration of cutting-edge algorithms, which
         deploy the fastest available ambulance to emergencies, prioritizing speed and effectiveness over
         proximity. This approach has earned Suwa Seriya recognition from the World Bank as one of the
         most digitally advanced and fastest ambulance servicesglobally (Innovating for Better Health,
         Saving Lives: Sri Lanka’s Ambulance Story, Martin Raiser, Vice President for South Asia, March
         2024). The use of advanced location tracking technology via a dedicated app ensures precise
         identification of callers’ locations, enabling rapid and accurate dispatch of emergency services.

         Moreover, 1990 Suwa Seriya’s commitment to operational readiness is evident through its
         meticulous attention to detail and proactive maintenance strategies. The introduction of AI
         and Mixed Reality technologies in the ‘Connected Ambulance’ pilot project further enhances
         emergency care. This innovation allows onboard Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) to deliver
         treatment to patients during transit, revolutionizing emergency medical care in Sri Lanka. Through
         these advanced technologies, 1990 Suwa Seriya has drastically improved operational efficiency and
         the delivery of emergency healthcare proving technology, if properly utilized, can help improve
         public service delivery in Sri Lanka. (Courtesy 1990 Suwa Seriya Foundation)

   08            REFORM
 The failures of the existing system, especially in the electricity sector, present an opportunity for
 renewal. The root cause of the failure, in our view, was the incentives that encouraged unsolicited
 proposals over time, leading to systemic breakdown. These lucrative deals allowed politicians
 and officials to manipulate government policy, delay cost-effective projects, obstruct transparent
 procurement, and even influence engineering decisions.

 8.1 EFFICIENT AND TRANSPARENT ENERGY MARKETS
 Our approach in power and energy will focus on implementing transparent, automated systems
 that minimize individual discretion, close loopholes for manipulation, and eliminate the incentives
 for ‘dealmakers’ to push unsolicited proposals.

 We believe the recently legislated CEB Act sets a foundation for reform in the electricity sector.
 However, while creating competition in generation and distribution is necessary, consumers
 and industries should not bear the burden of high energy costs due to monopoly power and
 inefficiency. We support cost-reflective electricity tariffs, but these costs must exclude corruption
 and inefficiency in power purchase agreements.

 We will reassess the proposed structure in the new Act and recommend amendments to enhance
 the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the reform process. Our priorities include establishing
 a fair electricity market, safeguarding consumer interests, improving accountability, and
 depoliticizing the industry. The regulator will also be empowered to prevent anti-competitive
 practices, monopolies, collusion, and abuses of dominant positions, following globally accepted
 methodologies to ensure a competitive electricity industry.

   Although some tariffs have been revised, there is a total lack of transparency in
    the methodology used. Pricing revisions should not be decided by politicians;
    the existing regulatory mechanism must be utilized with public consultations

   Utility providers should be allowed to charge cost-reflective tariffs, free of
    wastage and corruption costs, to break even.
   Ensure targeted subsidies for those in need, provided as transparent line
    items in the budget. We plan to offer these targeted subsidies via direct cash
    transfers.
   Automatically revise tariffs on a six-monthly basis on the aforementioned
    transparent formula. PUCSL will validate all costs in the pricing formula and
    approve the end-user tariff schedule generated by the tariff formula.
   The government has deviated from the existing indexed and fully cost
    reflective fuel price formula consistently over the last few years. The market
    price has been above the formula price, indicating that a significant additional
    revenue could have accrued to the treasury. We will make the necessary

8.2 RENEWABLE ENERGY
The SJB envisions not just meeting but exceeding the target for renewable energy generation
by 2030, aiming to make Sri Lanka a regional renewable energy powerhouse. We plan to
rapidly expand wind and solar capacity, leveraging natural resources and forming partnerships
with global, regional, and local power producers. Our goal is to make Sri Lanka a net exporter
of renewable energy, integrating with SAARC nations and beyond. To achieve this, we will
implement a comprehensive energy policy that streamlines the sector and attracts investment
through consistent regulations and macroeconomic stability. We will prioritize transparent and
competitive procurement processes and invest in cutting-edge technologies and infrastructure.
A crucial aspect of our vision is the potential for Sri Lanka to produce energy at significantly
lower costs through this transition to renewables. With competitive energy costs, we can boost
our industrial sector, attract energy-intensive industries, and enhance our overall economic
competitiveness in the global market.

  Land availability for on-shore projects and competitive approvals for offshore
   wind developments.
  Accelerate negotiations to clear blocks in installing ground mounted solar and
   installation of floating solar reservoirs across all feasible locations.
  Wind farms can have negative effects on local wildlife, especially the avian
   family and ecosystems. Thorough environmental assessments will be carried
   out and local communities engaged to addressing these concerns.
  Provide innovative financing mechanisms by collaborating with international
   partners to ease the upfront investments costs and reduce the long-term
   offtake risk in power purchase agreements (PPA).
  Improve grid infrastructure to accommodate intermittent energy via wind and
   solar.

   09           FACTOR MARKET REFORM

 9.1 LABOUR: DEVELOPING A SKILLED AND COMPETITIVE
 WORKFORCE
 Developing a skilled and competitive workforce is essential for Sri Lanka’s long-term success.
 According to the World Bank, Sri Lankan children could achieve 60% higher productivity with
 better education and healthcare. While the country excels in health, its educational outcomes
 lag behind competitors like Vietnam. To compete globally, Sri Lanka needs a workforce equipped
 for the modern economy. Although Sri Lanka performs well in health and primary education
 compared to South Asia, higher education, training, and labor market efficiency need significant
 improvement. Work ethic, restrictive labor regulations, and workforce skills are key areas for
 reform.

 Recognizing the importance of human capital development, our government will prioritize
 policies aimed at improving educational outcomes, developing job-relevant skills, and
 fostering innovation. Enhancing the quality and accessibility of education is crucial to building
 a competitive workforce. Programs will be implemented to ensure that Sri Lanka’s workforce
 possesses the skills necessary for the jobs of tomorrow. Additionally, fostering an environment that
 drives innovation and entrepreneurship will be essential for economic growth.

 Sri Lanka also faces a critical challenge with net outward migration, particularly among skilled
 professionals. In 2022, over 300,000 people left the country seeking foreign employment, causing
 a significant brain-drain that threatens the nation’s productivity and tax base. To address this, we
 plan to develop a skilled workforce through comprehensive education and training programs,
 create attractive career opportunities by collaborating with the private sector to establish
 competitive salaries and career development paths, and engage the Sri Lankan diaspora by
 utilizing their expertise and networks for national development.

 Sri Lanka’s education system must adapt to prepare students for the future workforce. Successful
 models from countries like Finland, Singapore, and Vietnam demonstrate the importance of
 collaboration, relaxed learning environments, and meeting basic needs such as school meals and
 healthcare. We recognize the critical role teachers play in this process. We will empower teachers
 through comprehensive training and resources, attract top talent to the teaching profession
 with competitive salaries and incentives, and focus on retaining qualified teachers, particularly
 in underserved areas. It is also important to modernize the curriculum to foster critical thinking,
 innovation, and adaptability. Additionally, we will invest in early childhood development programs
 to provide a strong foundation for success.

 As the next five years bring about technological, green, and supply-chain transformations, Sri
 Lanka must adapt its skills development programs to meet these emerging demands. The Future
 of Jobs Report (2023) identifies key areas for re-skilling, such as analytical skills, creative thinking,
 AI, big data, and leadership. These should be the focus on state-sponsored skills development
 programs. Improving the workforce’s work ethic is also crucial for enhancing competitiveness.

 During the ongoing economic crisis, , labour force participation has declined for both men and
 women . This is particularly concerning given the already low female participation rate of 30-35%
 over the past two decades despite high educational attainment among women. To address this
 issue, it is necessary to revise legislation based on the actual needs of current working women,

 Reforming and widening the labour market
 Revision of minimum wage: We propose to revise the minimum wage to Rs 25,000           S       M
 per month upon discussions with all stakeholders based on necessary regulations
 to National Minimum Wage of Workers Act. Note: The government recently
 decided to increase the minimum wage to Rs 17,500 per month. This however is
 not an adequate living wage given the minimum expenditure requirement to stay
 above the poverty line.
 Labour reform: The key central issue relating to labour market reforms in line             M
 with private-sector centred development strategy is how to design a mechanism
 to gain the support of the workers whose cooperation is crucial for the policies
 to work. Immediate beneficiaries (at least in the eyes of the workers) are the
 employers and the gains for the workers and the populace at large (in terms
 of higher market determined wages and better job prospects) come with a
 significant time lag. Making the policy work, therefore, require designing a
 mechanism to guarantee that both parties – workers and employees – have
 a reasonable chance to share in the benefits. Our ideology of a ‘social market
 Employers’ places a high value on the dignity of the worker and thus we are
 confident of a win-win solution.
 Immigration reform: Reforming the Immigrants and Emigrants Act No. 20 of                   M
 1948 to acquire inward talent. These reforms will support the growth of start-
 ups, particularly in the IT sector, by liberalizing the visa process. Key reforms
 include granting permanent resident visas to individuals of Sri Lankan origin and
 their families, introducing an investment visa similar to the United States EB-5
 program, a skilled visa program akin to the H1B Visa, and extending resident
 visas for non-Sri Lankan workers to two years. A new fast-track program, similar
 to the French Tech Visa, will be introduced for international start-up founders,
 employees, and investors.
 Women in the workforce: Promote women’s participation in the labour force                  S
 by improving maternity laws, introducing paternity laws, and implementing
 a national policy for day-care centres, including establishing day-cares at
 government institutions.

 contribute to the economy, providing incentives for skilled workers and improving
 their image as expatriates.

 9.2 LAND: IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY AND SECURING RIGHTS
 Despite the significant allocation of land to agriculture and the employment of 26.5% of the
 population in the sector, agriculture contributes only 7.5% to the GDP due to low productivity.

 Our government is committed to implementing a national land reforms program aimed at
 improving land productivity and securing land rights. A key priority will be the creation of a digital
 land registry, completing the ongoing Bim Saviya program. This digital transformation will address
 critical issues that hinder the productive use of land in Sri Lanka. It will provide a secure platform
 for land-related transactions, benefiting citizens, businesses, and government agencies. A digital
 registry for state land will also enable authorities to effectively track unutilized and allocated
 land. One approach to digitization includes integrating land data into a cadastral map within
 the National Spatial Database Infrastructure, facilitated by the Information and Communication
 Technology Agency.

 We will also continue the Urumaya land distribution program, which plays a vital role in improving
 livelihoods, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, enhancing food security, and expanding
 property rights in Sri Lanka. By identifying and allocating more land parcels, particularly in high-
 need areas, the government aims to increase the number of beneficiaries. Building on the strong
 foundation of the Urumaya program, the SJB government is dedicated to empowering families,
 boosting agricultural productivity, and contributing to the nation’s overall prosperity.

 Legal changes: Revise the Land Reform Act of 1972 to limit state intervention to              M
 public property, amend remove ceilings on agricultural land holdings to enable
 economies of scale, and establish a market-based value addition mechanism with
 the right to appeal in land acquisition cases.



9.3 CAPITAL: BOOST INFLOWS AND STRENGTHEN THE DOMESTIC
MARKET
Our government will swiftly implement reforms to boost capital inflows and strengthen the
domestic capital market. Key regulations will be reformed to enhance foreign direct investment
(FDI) and stimulate economic growth. Revisions to the Foreign Exchange Act No. 12 of 2017 will
amend foreign exchange controls, allowing citizens to invest through non-resident vehicles with
the same guarantees as foreign investors. As discussed in Section 6.1 the EC (BOI) will be reformed
to create a more open, attractive, and stable investment environment.

To support Sri Lanka’s development, it is crucial to leverage long-term funding from pension
and provident funds. Existing development and commercial banks should be utilized to channel
these funds effectively. This approach can be supplemented by foreign donors, concessionary
mechanisms, and a robust corporate debt market.

  10           STRONGER SOCIAL SAFETY NETS

GDP growth and the creation of wealth through reforms to enhance the market mechanism as
explained previously is only one of two components in our plan to develop Sri Lanka. The other is
the equitable distribution of that wealth, or economic justice. While Sri Lanka has not done well in
growth it has done even worse in distribution.

Official data just prior to the economic crisis suggested that the top 1% of Sri Lankans enjoy 15%
of national income while for the top 20%, it is 51%. Only 5% of national income accrues to the
bottom 20%. A recent study by UNDP found that wealth inequality was much worse, that the top
1% holds 31% of total personal wealth and the bottom 50% only 4%. The unprecedented economic
crisis further impacted the poor and vulnerable, making their protection and empowerment a
key priority in our economic revival plan. According to the World Bank Development Update 2024
poverty has doubled from 13.1% in 2021 to 25.9% in 2023. In this light, Sri Lanka’s social welfare
programs remain totally inadequate in both scope and reach.

To deal with the immediate crisis the government introduced, in 2023, the Aswasuma social
protection program to replace the cash transfer role of the (failed) Samurdhi scheme with the
Welfare Benefit Board (WBB) overseeing its implementation. Aswasuma has three aims: to reduce
inclusion and exclusion errors, increase administrative efficiency, and eliminate fragmentation in
social protection. However, the government has failed to address the critical needs of the poor and
the systemic issues within the social protection framework, and so has failed on all three counts.


A Jansaviya like new poverty alleviation program
Handing out cash for a period up to a few years will not alleviate poverty. Poverty itself must
be properly understood. It is appropriate to consider multidimensional poverty, measured as
outcomes in education, health standards, and standard of living to address the issues in a more
holistic way.

Addressing the issues of income and wealth inequality is a very serious public policy matter. We
believe fundamentally that social protection schemes should incentivize recipients to engage in
income-generating activities. Only, then poverty alleviation schemes could help people graduate
out of poverty in a specified period of time, not just doling out cash.

Thus, it is our position that we will in collaboration with the private sector, support welfare
recipients in acquiring skills and qualifications for employment, matching them with available
employment requirements and generally enabling them to lift themselves out of poverty in a job-
creating economy. The support shall be time bound. It will be structured as a participatory model
and will have a gender focus to promote the participation of women. Instead of just handing out
money, recipients would be required to participate in local community development activity or in
skills training to receive a given amount for consumption while the remainder shall be for future
investment, saved on a compulsory basis.

 Thus, we will completely revamp the current scheme to one that provides financial support
to transform the social safety net scheme to one that will safeguard vulnerable people while
facilitating upward social mobility.

Creating economic justice in subsidy distribution
Sri Lankans have for decades been heavily reliant on subsides as a method of social protection.
Many governments have continued to increase the value of subsides in nominal terms without
any limitation on duration or outcome. Subsidies are popular and win elections, but have severe
drawbacks form a fiscal as well as from an equity perspective. Key among them is that general
price subsides are not cost effective, they encourage overconsumption, and the larger quantum
accrues mainly to the rich increasing inequality in welfare. In our case, we saw how the issue
went beyond equity issues. Massive losses incurred by Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the
Ceylon Electricity Board due to such general untargeted subsidies contributed to huge debt
accumulation that led to the financial viability of these utilities impacting the entire banking
system. These losses contributed heavily to our inability to service debt.

While acknowledging the cost-based pricing mechanism for previously subsidised utilities and
noting the total inadequacy of focus on the low income on ability to pay, our government will
begin reforms in subsidy distribution to create greater equity and economic justice in the society,
by targeting them towards the needy. In stages we will add various types of subsidies to targeted
households as direct cash transfers. Targeting of households shall be based on means testing and
the ongoing population census will be the starting point. Over time general subsidies should be
replaced by well designed and cost effective strong social safety nets.


Population ageing and inclusive pension reform
Sri Lanka is already feeling the pressure of population aging. The old-age dependency ratio, or
the share of the population over 60 (65) years over the share of working people, has increased
from around 5% at the time of independence to about 18% today and is projected to exceed 50%
by 2050. With rising health costs, senior citizens face a different consumption basket than what is
reflected in the CCPI or NCPI, leading to a sharper drop in real incomes compared to the rest of the
population. Additionally, over 50% of the elderly population lacks a monthly pension, highlighting
the urgency of this issue.

In the short term, well-targeted cash benefits to the elderly poor and an interest subsidy to the
middle-class elderly who rely on fixed deposit interest income are necessary. The current interest
subsidy scheme for senior citizens is poorly targeted and includes the wealthiest individuals.
Additionally, reducing the cost of essential geriatric medication is vital.

For long-term sustainability, we propose a comprehensive overhaul of Sri Lanka’s pension system.
This involves creating a universal, contributory pension scheme that is accessible to all citizens,
including public service employees, private sector workers, and migrant workers. The existing
model, where public servants receive pensions without contributing, is financially unsustainable
and requires reform.

This pension system would offer retirees flexibility in how they receive their benefits, whether
through lump sum payments, regular pension payments, or a combination of both. EPF
contributors could be allowed to transfer part or all of their balances to the pension fund,
facilitating sector mobility while retaining pension benefits. The scheme would also promote labor
market flexibility and efficiency by reducing the appeal of government jobs and encouraging labor
mobility across sectors and even internationally.

To support this transition, we will implement financial education programs to equip citizens with
the knowledge needed for effective retirement planning and investment strategies. A gradual
transition will be essential to protect those nearing retirement while introducing reforms for
younger workers. Regular reviews will ensure the system’s sustainability and effectiveness over
time.

         Addressing Period Poverty – A Proposal for Menstrual Equity in Sri
         Lanka
         Period poverty, the inability to afford or access essential menstrual products, remains a significant
         issue in Sri Lanka, impacting the economic and educational outcomes of menstruating women.
         Nearly half of Sri Lanka’s women require hygienic sanitary products, yet in 2019, about 43% of
         households with menstruating women still didn’t report purchasing sanitary towels—a situation
         likely exacerbated by the pandemic and economic crisis.

         To combat this, we propose a targeted initiative to provide monthly vouchers worth Rs 500 to 1.2m
         schoolgirls in grades 6 to 13 to purchase sanitary napkin. This initiative, costing an estimated Rs 7
         billion annually will be structured as a self-targeting mechanism. The class teacher shall request
         the student (or parent) to register for the subsidy based on a QR code at the end of the school year
         (for the following year). This will allow the student or the parent to pay for the product monthly
         at selected outlets across the country. In extremely rural areas we shall utilize an appropriate
         distribution system

         This proposal not only addresses the immediate needs of schoolgirls but also aims to enhance
         long-term economic and social benefits for Sri Lanka’s broader community.



Stop the EPF being abused to provide better returns to members
The Employees Provident Fund has been misused by crooked elements over the years resulting
in the return on the members retirement funds being syphoned off. The 2019 Presidential
Commission of Inquiry on the activities of the bond market and the stock market found severe
malpractices that took place in EPF investments both in bonds and stocks. While the CoI found
massive losses to the EPF due to alleged fraudulent bond transactions, no one has been convicted
of these financial crimes. Recently some prominent businesspeople compounded their ‘pump
and dump on EPF’ transactions in the stock market after 13 years while the losses to the EPF were
not recovered. Our government will ensure that all those responsible for violating the EPF shall be
brought to book. Beyond that we will take action to put in place necessary legal and regulatory
infrastructure to make sure the retirement funds of the members do receive the best return
possible.

  During the transition from Aswesuma to new program, strengthen existing                    S       M
  welfare schemes, using digitization, enhance eligibility and increase capacity of
  the WBB
   Consolidate all welfare schemes under the Welfare Benefit Board (WBB) and
    establish a unified beneficiary database using a Unique ID model (DPI and
    Lanka Stack).
   Utilize the DPI to manage identified expenses of Aswasuma beneficiaries and
    their families. Extend system to provide food vouchers for families with infants
     under one year.
   Review and update the existing eligibility criteria for Aswasuma to minimize
    inclusion and exclusion errors. The ongoing national census shall be the basis for
    the correction. Regularly assess the beneficiary list using electricity usage as a
    preliminary criterion.
   Assign well trained WBB officers to every DS office, reporting directly to the
    WBB to ensure strong leadership and ownership.
   Integrate WBIS with other government databases, drawing on expertise from
    countries with advanced social protection schemes and multilateral agencies.
  Consolidate direct cash transfers: Cash transfers shall be provided directly                   S
  to bank accounts or mobile money accounts and be linked to the subsidy
  rationalising program across all programs. This will be enabled through the DPI
  system Lanka Stack. In the proposed model, a household shall receive a number
  of different cash transfers depending on need. Say, a subsidy for fuel, a subsidy
  for fertiliser, another one for sanitary pads for the menstruating schoolgirl in the
  family etc. We envision a mechanism of conditional spending to eliminate the
  subsidies being misused for, say alcohol.
  A ‘Janasaviya like’ new poverty alleviation program. As described, begin                   S       M
  structuring the new participatory program in consultation with the various
  stakeholders to create a win-win for all. Our proposal is for a Rs 20,000 per family
  for a 24-month term with an identified woman in the household (wife/mother/
  daughter) being responsible.
  Empower people with disabilities: Provide online education opportunities and              M        L
  support work-from-home jobs for people with disabilities.

  Veterans Administration: We shall establish a special office for all veterans related          M
  matters. This office shall coordinate with all government agencies to ensure all
  war veterans are provided the support they need.
  Creation of a universal contributory pension: We shall start developing a                      M
  contributory scheme that is accessible to all citizens, including public service
  employees, private sector workers, and migrant workers.
  Bring in new legislation to improve transparency in the EPF and introduce                  S       M
  worker representation on the Board: We will amend the current legislation to
  ensure the safety of the retirement fund including mandating regular forensic
  audits of its investments and also to bring in worker representation in to
  management of the fund.
  Temporary interest subsidy to senior citizens: To help the most impacted senior                S
  citizens due to the fall in interest rates on their fixed deposits, we shall introduce
  a temporary interest subsidy linked to the prevailing rate. The eligibility will be
  strictly enforced.

CONCLUSION: A PATH TO SHARED PROSPERITY
The Blueprint 3.0 lays out the SJB’s economic vision for Sri Lanka: that of a Social Market Economy
in which the individual freedom to innovate and compete is balanced by the stabilizing power of
social justice. We believe that this balance is the key to ensuring that Sri Lanka’s gradual recovery
from crisis turns into sustainable, equitable, inclusive growth.


Continuity and Change
We have already come some distance from the depths of the economic crisis in 2022, and
we acknowledge the positive changes that have taken place. This includes the government’s
productive engagement with the IMF, progress on debt restructuring, and much-needed
legislation on public finances, public debt, and monetary policy. The SJB will continue this path
to recovery – and speed up areas of reform that are lagging, particularly on corruption which
is continuing unabated – but will make essential targeted changes to ensure that Sri Lanka’s
economic recovery does not come at the expense of its people’s survival.


The Engines of Growth
While maintaining macro-economic stability and increasing government revenue is essential
for our recovery, we can no longer ignore the engines of growth. For long-term growth that
permanently lifts Sri Lanka out of the cycle of crisis, we must incentivise export-oriented sectors
and embrace outward-oriented policies. Through global integration, we free ourselves from the
constraints of a small domestic market. Sri Lanka will finally benefit from its strategic global
location, and Sri Lankans will see the benefit of belonging to a global marketplace. By “breaking
walls and building bridges to the world,” every sector – from agriculture, to industry, to services –
will have the opportunity to thrive and grow.


Reforms for Sustained Change
This journey will not be easy. Many of Sri Lanka’s structures and systems need to change for us to
achieve our true potential. Curbing government expenditure – including politically difficult actions
such as reforming the public sector and state-owned enterprises – is a must. Reforms in energy
and utilities markets are likewise essential, as is liberalising the overly regulated factor markets
of land, labour and capital. By leveraging digitization across all aspects of reform, we will boost
efficiency and productivity across all sectors.


A Win For All Sri Lankans
Inclusive sustainable development demands that we empower all citizens to participate in the
economy. However, we recognize that market economies generate income disparities. While
some inequality is inevitable, we must implement targeted social safety nets alongside our
market-oriented policies. Building a strong, transparent, and equitable social welfare system is
vital to achieve shared growth and ensure difficult economic reforms are accepted. We advocate
for direct consumer subsidies via cash transfers, ensuring resources reach those who need them
most. Finally, to truly empower its citizens, the government must respect them: by shunning
corruption, upholding good governance, and maintaining law and order.

This is our blueprint for a brighter future, for all Sri Lankans, today and for generations to come.
